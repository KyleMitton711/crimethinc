      description:
        "CrimethInc. is a rebel alliance—a decentralized network pledged to anonymous collective action—a breakout from the prisons of our age. We strive to reinvent our lives and our world according to the principles of self-determination and mutual aid.

        We believe that you should be free to dispose of your limitless potential on your own terms: that no government, market, or ideology should be able to dictate what your life can be. If you agree, *let’s do something about it.*"

    mantra:
      - If your heart is free, the ground you stand on is liberated territory. Defend it.
      - Only those prepared to go too far will learn how far they can go.
      - Desperate measures are long overdue.
      - Cradle the seed, even in the volcano’s mouth.
      - The future is in chains within you — set it free.
      - A spark for every powder keg.
      - Esperanza no espera.

        From passionate writing and meticulous editing, to intricate and unique design, to expert and careful production, these books are the result of much love and care. We’ve been at this for over a decade, and you’ll find the proof in all the tiny details and orchestrated moments that can only be achieved with ink-soaked paper.

        All our books are printed with soy ink on 100% post-consumer recycled paper by skilled artisans in Louisville, Quebec, Canada using the finest offset printing presses.

      crimethinc_into_libraries_intro: For those who don’t have the extra resources with which to buy books or who just aren’t excited about acquiring more possessions, we have good news for you—the [CrimethInc. Into Libraries program](/books/into-libraries). Our books are [in more libraries than you might guess](/2007/10/09/crimethinc-into-libraries-progress-report), and if not, you can probably get them onto the shelves, for free. [Find out how!](/books/into-libraries)

      literature_distro_kit_heading: Literature Distro Kit
      literature_distro_kit_intro: Our books are the cornerstone of our [Literature Distribution Kit](/books/lit-kit), an all-in-one literature distro for you to deploy how you see fit. It contains a mix of both books to sell and stuff to give away, everything you need to set up a table at a show, take on tour, or spread the word out of your backpack or break-room.
