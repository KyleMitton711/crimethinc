<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In our 34th episode, we follow themes of repression, security, and resistance through several different short features. In celebration of former Green Scare prisoner <a href="http://supporteric.org">Eric McDavid</a>&#8217;s release after nine years inside, we reflect on the lessons of his case for our efforts to resist today. We share part of <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2014/12/24/beyond-whistleblowing/">a recent CrimethInc. essay that assesses the possibilities and limits of whistleblowing</a>, as well as an <a href="http://freejasonhammond.blogspot.com/2015/01/statement.html">inspiring statement</a> by Jason Hammond (sibling of incarcerated hacktivist Jeremy Hammond) as he heads to prison for his role in an anti-fascist action. Ramona Africa speaks to us about the <a href="http://onamove.com">MOVE 9 case</a> and <a href="https://denverabc.wordpress.com/2015/01/12/phil-africa-passes-away/">the life and death of Phil Africa</a>, and an anarchist from Barcelona gives a report about the <a href="http://efectopandora.wordpress.com">recent wave of repression by the Spanish state in Operation Pandora</a>. Listeners weigh in on cable access TV, iTunes, and an insider view on security and entrapment strategies. We conclude with reflections on the lessons to be learned from these various cases and recent events on staying safe in order to be truly dangerous to authority. Plus as usual there are a lot of global news reports, event announcements, prisoner birthdays, and plenty more. <em>{February 12th, 2015}</em></p>

  <li><p>To learn more about the MOVE organization, check out <a href="http://onamove.com">onamove.com</a>. Here&#8217;s their <a href="https://denverabc.wordpress.com/2015/01/12/phil-africa-passes-away/">announcement about the death of Phil Africa.</a></p></li>
  <li><p>We received this message from Ramona Africa about harassment of another member of the MOVE 9, and how you can offer him some support:
  <em>&quot;ONA MOVE, everybody. Another disturbing situation has surfaced at SCI-Dallas. Our brother Delbert Africa has been without a cellmate since the passing of our brother Phil Africa. Dallas officials told Delbert that they would not give him a cellmate for a while, yet the other day Delbert was brought a new cellmate. The issue is, C.O. Lindler who works on Delbert’s block (Block I) has been trying to provoke Delbert, whether it was on his own because he hates MOVE, or because he had orders. Lindler was saying things like, “Everybody else has cellmates, what’s so special about him?” If this guard has a problem with MOVE people then he should request not to work Delbert’s block and leave our brother alone. This example is so outstanding because the whole jail knows that our brother, Phil, just passed and people don’t usually antagonize and try to provoke a person that has just lost a loved one. So what is Lindler’s problem? We are alerting people to this situation because it looks like they’re trying to provoke something with Delbert and we won’t let them get away with this treachery, we’re doing as JOHN AFRICA teaches us to do, we’re exposing it. Understand, this is not about Delbert having a cellmate or not, it’s about this guard misusing the situation to try to provoke Delbert. Robin Lucas is the superintendent’s assistant and the person to contact with your concerns. Her number is 570 674&#8211;1101, after the recording push 0 for operator and ask for her. Her email address is rlucas@pa.gov. Thanks for your continued support&#8212;-Ramona for the MOVE family</em></p></li>
