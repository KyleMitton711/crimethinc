<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this episode of the Ex-worker, we take another spin around the world, bringing you several short features focusing on various aspects of the global struggle against domination. We&#8217;ll share an interview with a Finnish anarchist, who tells us about an anti-nuclear struggle, a university occupation in Helsinki, and the response to refugees in Finland, and how anarchists have taken part in all of these. We&#8217;ll also hear statements from two Turkish anarchist collectives about the recent massacre of peace demonstrators in Ankara, Turkey. There&#8217;s also an update on repression from the Hambacher Forest occupation, a text from the streets of Santiago analyzing last month&#8217;s demonstrations against the anniversary of the coup by dictator Augusto Pinochet, and a report on the hunger strike of anarchist prisoner Evi Statiri in Greece—along with plenty of news, upcoming events, and more. <em>{November 17th, 2015}</em></p>

  <li><p>We&#8217;re excited to report that Igor, one of the Operation Fenix arrestees who was framed for an imaginary attack, has finally been released from custody on bail. You can read updates at <a href="http://antifenix.noblogs.org/post/2015/09/25/igor-byl-propusten-z-vazby-igor-was-released-from-custody/">antifenix.noblogs.org</a></p></li>
  <li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYgP8gacrxg">Here is a video of the attack against the police station in Athens, Greece</a> that we mentioned in the Hotwire, during a <a href="http://anarchistnews.org/content/incendiary-attack-against-exarcheia-police-station-athens-greece-1792015">demonstration in remembrance of murdered antifascist Pavlos Fyssas.</a> </p></li>
  <li><p><a href="https://itsgoingdown.org/indigenous-land-defenders-block-lng-terminal-construction/">Indigenous Lax Kw’alaams folks and supporters are blocking the boats of a Malaysian-owned energy company Petronas</a>, who are attempting to establish a liquid natural gas terminal on Lelu Island, unceded indigenous territory off the coast of British Columbia and <a href="http://flora-lelu.tumblr.com">an important habitat for shellfish and other aquatic life</a>. They&#8217;re calling for material support; <a href="http://www.laxuula.com">visit their website</a> to find out more information.</p></li>
  <li><p><a href="https://tacanka.wordpress.com/">Here&#8217;s a link to the website of the Taçanka anarchist collective</a> in Ankara Turkey, who wrote the statement we read in the coverage of the protests in Turkey following the murder of peace demonstrators. </p></li>
  <li><p>As soon as we get word about how to support or write to the imprisoned Hambacher Forest rebel, we&#8217;ll share it. In the mean time, you can get updates <a href="http://hambachforest.blogsport.de/repression/">on their website</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Animal rights activist Tyler Lang&#8217;s sentencing was moved to December 18th at 10:30 am. Tyler recently accepted a non-cooperating guilty plea to a single count of “conspiring to travel in interstate commerce with the purpose of damaging an animal enterprise”&#8230; aka vandalizing a fur farm, freeing about 2,000 mink, and causing between $120,000 and $200,000 in damage. <a href="http://supportkevinandtyler.com/court-support-for-tylers-sentencing-hearing/">Please come out and support him in court if you&#8217;re in the Chicago area!</a></p></li>
  <li><p>The To Change Everything tour is still chugging along; check out <a href="http://tcetour.noblogs.org/">their blog here</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2015/09/08/to-change-everything-us-tour-dates/">official tour site</a> to check if the tour will be coming through your town in it&#8217;s last few days. </p></li>
  <li><p>If you have two seconds and/or few extra bucks lying around, please consider bopping over to <a href="http://submedia.tv/tacos">Submedia.tv</a> and helping our comrades out during their taco-sourcing campaign. For even a small donation you&#8217;ll get some sick prizes, and might even experience some of those <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fimg.pandawhale.com%2Fpost-14725-Taco-cat-backwards-is-still-ta-mSjr.jpeg&amp;f=1">warm fuzzy feelings</a> that we in <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fmrconservative.com%2Ffiles%2F2013%2F10%2F2013.10.14-mrconservative-525bf5c56d1b4.jpg&amp;f=1">the business</a> like to refer to as “mutual aid” and “solidarity.” Let&#8217;s help them continue to expand their already extensive, unapologetic and irreverant front-lines coverage of global anti-capitalist and anti-colonial struggles– and help keep our <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Ftoronto.mediacoop.ca%2Fsites%2Fmediacoop.ca%2Ffiles2%2Fmc%2Fimagecache%2Fbigimg%2Fstimulator-screen_0.png&amp;f=">favorite floating face</a>&#8230; you know, afloat. </p></li>
  <li><p>From November 28th through December 12th, <a href="http://en.contrainfo.espiv.net/2015/09/29/paris-international-call-out-against-cop21/">mobilizations against the COP21 summit will be taking place in Paris, France.</a> Organizers report that &#8220;during the Summit, 195 governments and business leaders will gather to decide useless measures in order to &#8216;reduce greenhouse gas emissions,&#8217; but we know better: these quotas and policies as just another way for rich countries to grant themselves the right to pollute with impunity. Multiple days of demonstrations and discussions will be held during the conference; come with your initiatives and your will to create other ways of living, far away from the dictates of the economy.&#8221;</p></li>
  <li><p>Some upcoming bookfairs: The <a href="https://varjokirjamessut.wordpress.com/2015/08/10/varjokirjamessut-24-25-10-2015/">Helsinki Anarchist Book Fair</a> will take place on October 24&#8211;25, and the <a href="http://www.anarchistbookfair.org.uk/">London Anarchist Book Fair</a> is also on the 24th. And there will be an <a href="http://www.a-bookfair.org/">anarchist book fair in Tallinn, Estonia</a> on November 15th, as well.</p></li>
  <li><p>This news came in post-recording but we wanted to mention that Bomani Shakur (aka Keith laMar) <a href="http://www.lucasvilleamnesty.org/2015/11/keith-lamar-on-hungerstrike-protesting.html#more">began a hunger strike to protest his and 3 others conditions on Ohio&#8217;s Death Row.</a> Shakur is one of five inmates who have been handed a death sentence by the State of Ohio for their participation in the infamous lucasville prison uprising in 1993. In October Bomani lost his final appeal and could have his execution date set soon. </p></li>
  <li><p>Here are the addresses of the two prisoners with birthdays that we mentioned at the end of this episode. They&#8217;re a little bit past now, but please still consider sending them a card! </p>
