    <description><![CDATA[<p>Our first walking tour! Protesters descending on Washington, D.C. to <a href="http://www.disruptj20.org/">#DisruptJ20</a> are stepping into a long history of resistance in the belly of the beast. One of the most innovative and powerful cycles of protest in the nation’s capital was <a href= "http://www.infoshop.org/Anti-Capitalist-Movements">the movement against corporate globalization</a> in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Most tours of D.C. take you around the monuments and museums downtown, but we want to show you another side of the city—the neighborhoods and <a href= "http://www.anarchistagency.com/in-the-news/the-verge-4chan-trolls-want-to-quell-anti-trump-dissent-by-shutting-down-diy-venues-and-art-spaces/"> DIY spaces</a> from which anarchists launched attacks on capital and where seeds were planted for a new world to take its place. Through historic sites, interviews, and a scrapbook of anti-capitalist mementos, we hope to pass on some of the lessons and inspiration that the anti-globalization movement can offer, especially as a new wave of struggle begins under Trump. {January 9, 2017}</p> <p> </p> <p>-------SHOW NOTES------</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>We’ve put together a YouTube version of the walking tour with the photos included at our <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDpLLLw4bOnUNP1xod1SY0A/videos">YouTube channel</a></li> <li>Anarchist history is not for books you can close and set away on a shelf.

You can start next week with the #DisruptJ20 anti-inaugural activities in <a href= "http://www.disruptj20.org/">DC on January 20th.</a></li> <li>We discuss and sample multiple documentaries about the mass anti-corporate globalization protests that took place during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>We know you’ve been on the edge of your seat, waiting for see which candidate will receive the Ex-Worker’s endorsement for president this year. In <a href= "http://crimethinc.com/podcast/52">Episode 52</a>, we offer an Ex-Voter’s guide to the 2016 election, including an analysis of the risks we anticipate in its aftermath titled <a href= "http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/r/reaction/">After the Election, the Reaction</a>. There’s lots of listener feedback to discuss, including advice for a young anarchist on less illegal or risky forms of anarchist action, updates about conflict between the Turkish state and the forces of Rojava, and a nuanced discussion of what “solidarity” really means, or should mean, in concrete terms. On the Chopping Block, we undertake a work of fiction for the first time, Nanni Balestrini’s <em>Vogliamo Tutto</em>, or <a href= "https://www.versobooks.com/books/2114-we-want-everything">We Want Everything</a>. There’s also an announcement about some upcoming CrimethInc. developments, along with <a href= "https://nycabc.wordpress.com/pppow-birthday-calendar/">prisoner birthdays</a> and more. We released this episode in tandem with an audio zine exploring anarchist critiques of voting, elections, and representative democracy, which you can download as <a href= "http://crimethinc.com/podcast/51">Episode 51</a>. {November 7, 2016}</p> <p> </p> <p>-------SHOW NOTES------</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Our discussion of the 2016 Presidential election and its likely aftermath centered around <a href= "http://www.crimethinc.com/texts/r/reaction/">After the Election, the Reaction</a>, the recently published text from the CrimethInc. blog.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Do anarchists vote? If not, how do we express our voice and participate in changing society? What’s the problem with elections and representative democracy? In this special Election Day audio zine,we describe why electing representatives robs us of our power, refute common arguments made to convince us of the value of voting, explain direct action as an alternative approach for making change without politicians and parties, and lay out our vision for a free world beyond electoral politics. We begin by surveying anarchist responses to elections from the 19th century to the present day, and include excerpts from CrimethInc. interventions against the last few presidential elections, including <a href= "http://crimethinc.com/tools/downloads/zines.html">“Don’t Just Vote, Get Active: A Community Non-Partisan Voters’ Guide”</a> (2004), <a href= "http://crimethinc.com/tools/downloads/zines.html">“Voting vs. Direct Action”</a> (c. 2004), <a href= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront.crimethinc.com/pdfs/falsehopevsrealchange.pdf"> “False Hope vs. Real Change”</a> (2008), <a href= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront.crimethinc.com/pdfs/democracy_reading.pdf"> “The Party’s Over”</a> (c. 2009), and the <a href= "http://www.crimethinc.com/tools/vote/">“Democracy is Bankrupt”</a> website (2012). This audio zine provides background for our discussion of the 2016 presidential campaign and its likely aftermath, which appears in <a href= "http://crimethinc.com/podcast/52">Episode 52</a>. Whoever they vote for, we are ungovernable! {November 7, 2016}</p> <p>-------SHOW NOTES------</p> <ul> <li>This audio zine draws on several previously published CrimethInc. texts that address voting, elections, democracy, and direct action, including <a href= "http://crimethinc.com/tools/downloads/zines.html">“Don’t Just Vote, Get Active: A Community Non-Partisan Voters’ Guide”</a> (2004), <a href= "http://crimethinc.com/tools/downloads/zines.html">“Voting vs. Direct Action”</a> (c. 2004), <a href= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront.crimethinc.com/pdfs/falsehopevsrealchange.pdf"> “False Hope vs. Real Change”</a> (2008), <a href= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront.crimethinc.com/pdfs/democracy_reading.pdf"> The Party’s Over"</a> (c. 2009), and the <a href= "http://www.crimethinc.com/tools/vote/">“Democracy is Bankrupt”</a> website (2012).</li> <li>In the introduction, we quoted a variety of historical anarchist critiques of elections, voting, and representative democracy, including: Mikhail Bakunin, <a href= "https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/michail-bakunin-on-representative-government-and-universal-suffrage"> "On Representative Government and</a> ; Peter Kropotkin, <a href= "https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-revolutionary-government"> “Revolutionary Government”</a>; Elisee Reclus, <a href= "https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/elisee-reclus-why-anarchists-don-t-vote"> “Why Anarchists Don’t Vote”</a>; Henry David Thoreau, <a href= "http://thoreau.eserver.org/civil.html">“Civil Disobedience”</a>; Emma Goldman, <a href= "https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/emma-goldman-anarchism-and-other-essays#toc11"> “Woman Suffrage”</a>; Zo d’Axa, <a href= "https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/zo-d-axa-he-is-elected">“He Is Elected”</a>; and <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHecHglKjHQ">the Yippies’ nomination of Pigasus</a>. You can find many more anarchist critiques on these themes <a href= "https://theanarchistlibrary.org/category/topic/anti-voting">via The Anarchist Library</a>.</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>As we build momentum towards the <a href= "http://supportprisonerresistance.net">September 9th national prison strike</a>, we want to reflect on lessons learned from past generations of prison rebels, as well as how we can maintain energy on September 10th and beyond.

To learn more about the revolution in Rojava, listen to our previous coverage in <a href="http://crimethinc.com/podcast/36/">Episode 36</a> and <a href="http://crimethinc.com/podcast/39/">Episode 39</a>, and check out <a href="http://www.supportrojava.org/">Rojava Solidarity NYC</a>’s book <a href= "http://www.combustionbooks.org/products-page/non-fiction/a-small-key-can-open-a-large-door-the-rojava-revolution/"> “A Small Key Can Open A Large Door: The Rojava Revolution”</a>.</li> <li>We shared an excerpt from an <a href= "http://radiostudent.si/dru%C5%BEba/%C4%8Drna-luknja/sodobno-anarhisti%C4%8Dno-organiziranje-v-tur%C4%8Diji"> interview with Devrimci Anarşist Faaliyet (DAF), or Revolutionary Anarchist Action</a>, an anarchist organization based in Istanbul, Turkey. Thanks to our friends at <a href= "http://radiostudent.si/dru%C5%BEba/%C4%8Drna-luknja">Crna Luknja</a> in Ljubljana, Slovenia for sharing it with us. Learn more about DAF via <a href="http://anarsistfaaliyet.org/">their website</a> or their <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/anarsistfaaliyetorg">Facebook page</a>.</li> <li>The US “Justice” Department <a href= "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/08/18/private-prison-stocks-collapse-after-justice-department-promises-to-phase-them-out/"> recently announced its intention to phase out the use of private prisons</a>. Good news, right? Well… <a href= "https://itsgoingdown.org/bloc-party-claim-no-easy-victories/">these anarchists don’t necessarily think so</a>. Either way, it’s unquestionable that prison privatization has horrible consequences for the incarcerated; if you weren’t already convinced, check out <a href= "http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/06/cca-private-prisons-corrections-corporation-inmates-investigation-bauer"> this massive expose by Mother Jones magazine about the corruption and brutality of private prison industry</a>, written by an undercover reporter who actually got a job as a guard in a CCA prison; it’s fascinating, horrifying reading. But the question is whether this reform will serve to weaken or strengthen mass incarceration in the long run. As Ben Turk mentions in his interview, the so-called “prison reform movement” led by such luminaries as Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich exists not to abolish prisons, but to generalize carceral logics across all of society.</li> <li>Check out the <a href= "https://itsgoingdown.org/defend-zad-call-international-solidarity/"> call for solidarity on October 8th with la ZAD</a>, the anti-airport occupation in western France.

    <description><![CDATA[<p><em>Is Democracy what we’re fighting for, as anarchists?</em> In episode 47 of the <em>Ex-Worker Podcast</em>, a contentious debate between Clara and Alanis on this topic sets the stage for an upcoming, in-depth engagement with the topic of Democracy. In addition, we clean out our backlog of listener feedback, clarifying our trash-talking of both the Bay Area and Adbusters in past episodes, as well as hearing from a listener in Australia about <a href="http://slackbastard.anarchobase.com/">various</a> <a href="https://blackrosenewtown.wordpress.com/">online</a> <a href="https://disaccords.wordpress.com/">resources</a> for finding out what’s happening with anarchist and anti-fascists in the land down under. <a href="http://nycabc.wordpress.com">NYC Anarchist Black Cross</a> provides us with thorough political prisoner updates, and we share a review of the book <em>Huye Hombre Huye</em>, <a href="http://littleblackcart.com/books/anarchy/huye-hombre-huye.-diary-of-a-maximum-security-prisoner./">available from Little Black Cart</a>. As always, the episode is bookended with global news updates, plus <a href="https://nycabc.wordpress.com/pppow-birthday-calendar/">prisoner birthdays</a>, a whole slew of upcoming anarchist bookfairs and other events and more. <em>{March 16, 2016}</em></p> <p>-------SHOW NOTES------</p> <ul> <li>New York Anarchist Black Cross (NYC ABC) is doing a fantastic job of keeping us updated on political prisoners and prisoners of war. If you’re looking for a comprehensive overview of political prisoners in the US, you can check out their new <a href="https://nycabc.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/nycabc_polprisonerlisting_11-1feb2016.pdf">Illustrated Guide to Political Prisoners</a>. It’s got detailed info on all their cases including up to date mailing addresses plus tips on writing to prisoners; it’s a great overview if you want to support radical prisoners but aren’t sure where to start.</li> <li>Dr. Mutulu Shakur, a longtime black liberation prisoner who helped Assata Shakur escape to freedom, was supposed to be released from prison in February… but his release was denied at the last minute. He’ll be facing the parole board later this spring. Here’s a link to <a href="http://mutulushakur.com/site/2016/02/2016-denial-of-release/">a statement he wrote explaining the situation with more info on how to show support</a>. Supporters have also launched a new website at <a href="http://mutuluiswelcomehere.com/">MutuluIsWelcomeHere.com</a> to gather stories describing his the positive impacts he has made and to organize solidarity events leading up to his parole hearing.</li> <li>Former Black Panther Maliki Shakur Latine will also be heading to the parole board in April, and he’s collecting parole letters; check out <a href="http://justiceformaliki.org/2016/02/13/call-for-letters-of-support-for-maliki-latines-release-on-parole/">justiceformaliki.org</a> for details.</li> <li>Supporters of Brandon Baxter (one of the Cleveland Four, anarchists active in the Occupy movement who were entrapped in an FBI plot) are doing <a href="https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/bwdEe/ab/746Ym0">a small fundraising campaign right now to help with costs to get him some visitors</a> in his new digs at FCI Terre Haute in Indiana. Brandon hasn’t received any visitors since his sentencing, and he’s never had a in person visit since his arrest. He’s about 11 hours away from his supporters who plan to visit and they need to raise some money for a car rental. They’re only a couple of hundred bucks short, so even if you can throw in a few dollars it’ll make a difference. Any donations not used for this trip will go into the general fund to support the Cleveland Four getting visitors. To learn more about their case, check out cleveland4solidarity.org or listen to <a href="http://crimethinc.com/podcast/17">Episode 17</a> on Conspiracy.</li> <li>Eric King, an anarchist from Kansas City accused of an alleged attack on a politician’s office, has accepted a non-cooperating plea deal for a ten year prison sentence; after time served, he’s got eight and a half years left to go. On top of this, the facility where he’s locked up CCA is now on lock-down, and <a href="https://supportericking.wordpress.com/2016/02/25/eric-has-been-placed-back-in-segregation/">Eric has been put in solitary confinement</a>. Please take a few minutes to send Eric a postcard or letter to remind him that folks are thinking of him. <br /><br /> Eric King 27090045<br /> CCA Leavenworth<br /> 100 Highway Terrace<br /> Leavenworth, KS 66048</li> <li>Former earth liberation prisoner Daniel McGowan will be in court on <a href="https://ccrjustice.org/home/get-involved/events/oral-arguments-aref-v-holder-cmu-case">March 15th in Washington, DC to support the Center for Constitutional Rights’ case against the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ “Communication Management Units.”</a> The CMUs are experimental prison units that impose severe restrictions on prisoners’ communications, both within the prison and with the outside world. If you’re in the DC area and you want to show some solidarity against a particularly vicious form of repression - one that has primarily targeted Muslims and political radicals - you can find the info on our website.</li> <li>On March 23, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1559139881065937/">Tyler Lang has his sentencing hearing</a> for his charges under the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act for releasing thousands of animals from a fur farm. If you can be in Chicago, please attend the hearing to show support for Tyler. It is important that on this difficult day for Tyler that he feel surrounded by love and solidarity, and that the judge see that Tyler is part of a community that is there for him. His co-defendant Kevin Olliff was sentenced to three years, which with time serve means he’s only got about three months left to go!</li> <li>J ay Chase of the NATO 3 has one more pretrial hearing in Chicago on March 23rd - actually at the same time as Tyler Lang’s sentencing hearing, though in a different courtroom, before he goes to trial on April 11th. Supporters ask anyone to come out who’s able and to continue sending Jay support through letters or mailing softcover books.

Here’s how they describe themselves: <em>Appalachia Resist! is a small group of rural activists who use direct action as a tactic to resist the fracking industry in our region. We work and live in a rural working class community that is predominant white. We see that struggles for environmental justice and the ongoing fight for racial justice are linked. We want to articulate that link and find concrete ways to work together to push back against a system that brutalizes and sees as disposable the bodies of low income rural people, people of color, gender nonconforming people, women, native, and undocumented people. Mentioning all these people together should not be a way of erasing difference (this is not “all lives matter”) but a way of seeking actual solidarity based on mutual liberation. This is a monumental task, and we are definitely not experts. But we think it’s important and necessary.</em> They’re encouraging regional activists working on racial justice, anti-rape culture, prison solidarity and prison abolition, environmental justice and anti-extraction, and other struggles to take part.</li> <li>In Seoul, South Korea, the <a href="http://blog.jinbo.net/attach/6956/1172280669.jpg">Anarchist Film Festival of Hannam-dong</a> will open March 24th through 26th at “Take Out Drawing”, an art space standing in defiance of gentrification in downtown Seoul.</li> <li>On April 23rd at Stone Mountain, outside Atlanta, Georgia, there’s a big white supremacist rally planned, and anti-fascists around the region are gearing up to shut it down. Check out the website <a href="https://alloutatl.com/">alloutatl.com</a> for more info on the mobilization; it articulates some shared principles that address some of the nuances of diverse anti-racist mobilizations in a particularly thoughtful way.</li> <li>The anarchist book fair season kicks off in earnest in April, with book fairs in <a href="http://www.ask-zagreb.org/engleski.htm">Zagreb, Croatia</a> on the 8th through 10th; <a href="http://www.wsm.ie/c/dublin-anarchist-bookfair-latest">Dublin, Ireland</a> on the 15th and 16th; <a href="https://sheffieldbookfair.org.uk/">Sheffield, UK</a> on the 23rd, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1674009279509210/">Oakland, California</a> on the 26th, and <a href="http://www.bristolanarchistbookfair.org/">Bristol, UK</a> on the 30th, followed by <a href="http://buechermesse.ch/?lang=en">Bern, Switzerland</a> on May 6th and 7th.</li> <li><a href="https://nycabc.wordpress.com/pppow-birthday-calendar/">Prisoner birthdays</a> this Month: <br /><br /> <a href="http://letlukego.wordpress.com">Luke O’Donovan</a> #1001372271<br /> Washington State Prison<br /> P.O.

These same guards were allowed to testify against him during the NATO 3 sentencing in a somewhat successful attempt to bring a harsher sentence and now they will likely testify against him in this case . . . This trial is not just about a few extra years being tacked on to his current sentence which is coming to an end in May.

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In our first episode of the new year, the Ex-Worker looks back over 2015 and its highlights, lowlights, and everything in between. We summarize some of the year’s key news developments, including tech developments and struggles around gender, anarchist publishing and media, a hilarious look at mass media coverage of anarchism, and our reflections on the last year of the podcast itself and our new year’s resolutions. You’ll also hear some analysis of some of the important themes within anarchism and revolutionary struggles in 2015, including an extended discussion on identity and solidarity, a review of the AK Press anthology “Taking Sides”, and reflections on our relationship to mass movements. The anarchist news website “It’s Going Down” contributes their end of year thoughts, a new project called “The Spaces Between” sets out to document US anarchism outside of its major urban hotspots, and a supporter offers an important update on NATO 3 prisoner Jared “Jay” Chase. We also received a number of detailed and inspiring year in review reports from anarchists around the world … but we’ll save those for our next episode.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In our 44th episode of the Ex-worker, and our final episode of 2015, we bring you a live audio recording from the last stop of the recently wrapped-up To Change Everything tour, an international panel discussion featuring stories and lessons from participants in some of the better and lesser known uprisings of the last few years. In two months and just over 50 stops, the featured speakers—hailing from Slovenia, Brazil, the Czech Republic and the U.S.—presented their perspectives on topics ranging from the common pitfalls of making demands, the rise of nationalism and fascism, and the importance of solidarity in the face of state repression. Stay tuned to the end of the episode where we propose some ideas for maintaining some of these valuable, face-to-face connections that have been made while on the tour. In addition, we’re releasing this episode in conjunction with the full tour report-back, so make sure you check that out as well.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>One of the major news stories of 2015 has been the flow of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Syria and beyond into Europe, and the social and political crises this has precipitated. In this episode, we'll take a look at Europe's so-called refugee crisis from an anarchist perspective. To do that, we adopt a "mix tape" format, pasting together excerpts from a variety of sources to offer an impressionistic look at how and why people move across the world, the barriers thrown up by states to impede and control them, and popular resistance against the system of national borders. We begin with reflections on borders from the CrimethInc. Contradictionary, To Change Everything, and past Ex-Worker episodes, and continue with excerpts from interviews with No One Is Illegal activist Harsha Walia, author Vijay Prashad, and a Swiss anarchist active in migrant solidarity struggles in Europe, as well as essays from an activist convergence against climate change, Calais Migrant Solidarity, and Mask Magazine; and conclude with reflections on the Islamic State attacks in Paris from the CrimethInc. blog. You'll also hear updates on anti-anarchist repression in Spain and anti-government demonstrations in South Korea, a report-back from the Rebel! Rebuild! Rewild! action camp in eastern Canada, and an announcement for a new prisoner publication, plus news, upcoming events, and more.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Ex-worker, we take another spin around the world, bringing you several short features focusing on various aspects of the global struggle against domination. We'll share an interview with a Finnish anarchist, who tells us about an anti-nuclear struggle, a university occupation in Helsinki, and the response to refugees in Finland, and how anarchists have taken part in all of these. We'll also hear statements from two Turkish anarchist collectives about the recent massacre of peace demonstrators in Ankara, Turkey. There's also an update on repression from the Hambacher Forest occupation, a text from the streets of Santiago analyzing last month's demonstrations against the anniversary of the coup by dictator Augusto Pinochet, and a report on the hunger strike of anarchist prisoner Evi Statiri in Greece—along with plenty of news, upcoming events, and more.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, the Ex-Worker explores connections between anarchism, repression and resistance across the world in countries that rarely appear in the radical limelight. We share an interview with an Anarchist Black Cross chapter in Belarus, discussing the president's recent release of anarchist political prisoners; interview a Czech anarchist about "Operation Fenix" and recent entrapment cases and terrorism charges leveled at anarchists there; and provide more context to last episode's call to flag-burning action from South Korean anarchists by examining the historical and political contexts of the flag for Korean radicals. We also discuss the Suruc massacre and developments among Kurdish struggles in Turkey and Syria, and expand our ongoing discussion of the concept of "terrorism" through the lens of a court ruling about gangs in El Salvador. Listener thoughts on Zeitgeist, conspiracy theories, and small-town anarchism, debunking the myth of "cops under attack" since the emergence of Black Lives Matter, and an announcement of the CrimethInc. "To Change Everything" US tour top off our usual collection of global news updates, prisoner birthdays, event announcements, and more. {September 15, 2015}</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>It's been a year since rage over Michael Brown's murder catalyzed an anti-racist and anti-police rebellion that spread from Ferguson around the country. How can anarchists interpret the trajectory of the struggles against white supremacy that have unfolded over the last year? In Episode 40, we discuss the current state of police violence and both institutional and autonomous white supremacy, alongside an analysis of how anti-racist and anti-police resistance developed from Ferguson to Baltimore to South Carolina. A listener weighs in on the risks of militarism, from the Iron Column in the Spanish Civil War to the militias in Rojava today. Comrades from Korea share updates on state repression and issue an exciting call for international solidarity, and Clara and Alanis discuss the politics of the term ''terrorism'' and how to undertake assertive resistance to state repression without resorting to sports metaphors. {September 3, 2015}</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In the latest episode of the Ex-Worker, we continue our discussion of the unfolding social revolution in the autonomous Kurdish territories of Rojava. Building on our coverage in Episode 36, we share two interviews themed around international solidarity with the struggle for autonomy and the fight against ISIS. In the first, a member of Rojava Solidarity NYC, the group of American anarchists that produced the book "A Small Key Can Open a Large Door", discusses democratic confederalism and the council system in the cantons, compares and contrasts the Zapatista uprising with the Rojava revolution, and describes the solidarity projects they've undertaken and what's at stake for anarchists in our response to the events in Kurdistan. In the second, a member of the Turkish anarchist group Social Insurrection discusses his experience fighting with the United Freedom Forces militia. We address some critiques of the revolutionary structures in Rojava as well as our coverage of them and trace the emergence of international solidarity brigades. A member of Antifa International announces the formation of an International Anti-fascist Defense Fund, and we share info about several recently released anarchist publications. Our discussion of the news takes on Obama's sudden transformation into a prison reform advocate, indigenous resistance to profiteering off alcoholism, and the outing of a corporate infiltrator into the animal rights movement, while our indignant coverage of Syriza's entirely predictable betrayal of Greek social movements in their EU bailout austerity proposal concludes with a helpful diagnosis of "The Five Stages of Leftism". {July 27, 2015}</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>How do anarchists organize outside of major cities? In Episode 38 of the Ex-Worker, we offer a profile of anarchism in Lake Worth, a small coastal town in southern Florida with a surprisingly active and vibrant culture of resistance. Participants in the Everglades Earth First!, the Earth First! Journal, the South Florida Prison Books Project, the former Night Heron Infoshop, and Prison Legal News discuss the many radical projects that operate out of Lake Worth. We even hear from a former anarchist elected official discussing the contradictions and possibilities of that position! The episode also includes a CrimethInc. tour announcement, feedback from listeners about online crypto-anarchism, appeals for solidarity, plenty of news from all over the world, and more.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, the Ex-Worker offers an in-depth profile of the struggle to defend the Hambacher Forest. In the Rhineland coal country of western Germany, a group of angry locals, environmentalists, anarchists and squatters have converged to challenge the destruction of one of the region's oldest forests by the energy giant RWE's brown coal mining. In these moving interviews recorded live in the Hambacher Forest in spring 2014, Clara gets a tour of the occupation and discusses the recent history of actions and broader political context. Through insightful and often hilarious informal conversations, the occupiers point out distinctive features of the forest, show the gritty and frequently comical day to day realities of squatter life, discuss their personal motivations for resisting the destruction of the forest, and offer poignant insight into the logic of resistance as a way of life. The episode concludes with recent updates from the occupation, ways to participate and show solidarity, and reflections on its significance for radicals across the world.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Ex-Worker is back! We may have taken a break, but social struggles and resistance across the world have not. In this episode, we focus on the unfolding social revolution in Rojava or western Kurdistan, where an ambitious set of political, economic, and military experiments are transforming the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. In the borderlands of Turkey and Syria, self-organized militias have successfully opposed the Islamic State while challenging gender oppression and securing autonomy for an emerging stateless society. Interviews with supporters from the Turkish group "Revolutionary Anarchist Action" (DAF) set the stage, complemented by a Kurdish refugee and activist's reflections on the role of women's resistance to patriarchy. We also review "A Small Key Can Unlock a Large Door," a recently released anthology of texts describing the Rojava revolution, and continue our yearly tradition of a lively report of May Day actions across the globe. We also respond to a variety of listener feedback, with discussions of the Ross Ulbricht case, anarchist parenting, and how even spambots are impacted by recent revolutionary struggles!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In our 34th episode, we follow themes of repression, security, and resistance through several different short features. In celebration of former Green Scare prisoner Eric McDavid's release after nine years inside, we reflect on the lessons of his case for our efforts to resist today. We share part of a recent CrimethInc. essay that assesses the possibilities and limits of whistleblowing, as well as an inspiring statement by Jason Hammond (sibling of incarcerated hacktivist Jeremy Hammond) as he heads to prison for his role in an anti-fascist action. Ramona Africa speaks to us about the MOVE 9 case and the life and death of Phil Africa, and an anarchist from Barcelona gives a report about the recent wave of repression by the Spanish state in Operation Pandora. Listeners weigh in on cable access TV, iTunes, and an insider view on security and entrapment strategies. We conclude with reflections on the lessons to be learned from these various cases and recent events on staying safe in order to be truly dangerous to authority. Plus as usual there are a lot of global news reports, event announcements, prisoner birthdays, and plenty more.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>From the Ukrainian revolution and war with Russia to the Bosnian uprisings, ISIS/Rojava/Kobane conflicts, the Brazilian World Cup protests, anti-police riots in Ferguson and beyond … 2014 was one hell of a depressing, inspiring, roller coaster of a year! For our year in review, we wrote to anarchists around the world to ask them what they thought were the most significant events of the last year and what they anticipate in 2015. Responses came in from correspondents as far off as Brazil, Russia, Columbia, Slovenia, Finland, and Germany, as well as across North America, with reports about 2014 and analysis of the possibilities for resistance in the upcoming year. We also stop to take stock of the last year of the Ex-Worker, and reveal some schemes and dreams for our next year of anarchist podcasting. And as if that wasn't enough, we share an exclusive report on squatting, eviction, and resistance in Prague, an analysis of recent anti-police rioting in Oakland, and discussions on listener feedback about Agency's Ebola article and the police in relation to the state, along with plenty of news, prisoner birthdays, and more. {January 20th, 2015}</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Rebellion has erupted around the country in the aftermath of grand jury decisions to allow the murderers of Mike Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in New York to go free without legal charges. Why did this happen, when authorities knew that this would spark furious protests and international condemnation? To try to understand the persistence of racist police violence, Clara and Alanis delve into the historical roots of capitalism and white supremacy from the origins of European conquest and colonization of the Americas. Along with a survey of resistance and backlash since the grand jury announcements, we share excerpts from the recent feature "The Thin Blue Line is a Burning Fuse," tracing the role of anti-police anger in catalyzing nearly all recent major social upheavals around the globe. Agency, a new anarchist media project, shares an excerpt from an article analyzing the Ebola outbreak and anarchist perspectives on public health. We run through a wide range of news, discuss listener comments on transcripts and international coverage, and even offer a radical holiday song!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The Ex-Worker keeps our eyes to the south as we continue our in-depth exploration of anarchism in Chile. While our last episode sought to provide context and history, this episode delves into two recent cases of repression by the Chilean State against anarchists and discusses the important of prisoner support in the anarchist movement. We interview Victor Montoya, an anarchist who was framed up and spent 16 months in pretrial detention, as well as Luciano "Tortuga" Pitronello, a comrade who faced terrorism charges after a bomb he was carrying prematurely detonated. While Tortuga's body was damaged in the course of this ordeal, his spirit remains resilient, and he shares inspiring stories and sage advice over vegan sandwiches at the autonomous library Sante Geronimo Caserio in Santiago. We'll offer a review of the Chicago Conspiracy, a documentary film which illustrates some of Chile's radical history and present through music, celebration, memory and riot, tackle some thoughtful listener feedback about democracy and anarchy, and top it all off with news from struggles around the globe.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>On September 11th, while patriotic Americans waved flags and listened to speeches, a few thousand miles south, Chileans massed in the streets and clashed with police on the anniversary of the 1973 military coup. Our 29th episode begins a two-episode series on anarchism in Chile: From popular power and militant resistance to the Pinochet dictatorship to today's clashes between <em>encapuchados</em> and <em>Carabineros</em> across burning barricades, we explore the history and background context necessary to understand the distinctive and militant anarchist struggles of contemporary Chile. From the recent anarchist book and propaganda fair in Santiago, several anarchists speak with us about the importance of radical neighborhoods, the evolution of public anarchist organizing, and political imprisonment in Chile. Attendees of the marches and actions during the recent Climate Convergence in New York City report on their experiences and reflect on how anarchists connect to broader environmental movements. Listeners weigh in on historical dates, pronunciation mistakes, and mind-controlled drones, alongside news, announcements, and prisoner birthdays.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In Episode 26, we shared a panorama of dramatic stories from the lives and struggles of 19th and early 20th century anarchist women... but we didn't focus much on their ideas. In the second episode of our three-part series on anarcha-feminism, the Ex-Worker returns to the first generations of rebels who brought together anarchist and feminist currents, this time to explore their distinctive revolutionary visions. We survey the context of early revolutionary and feminist ideas, and the distinct perspectives of early anarcha-feminists on marriage, sexuality, economic and bodily autonomy, suffrage, revolutionary sexism, and strategies for women's emancipation. The Chopping Block discusses Free Women of Spain, the classic study of the Spanish anarcha-feminist group Mujeres Libres. Listeners weigh in on sports, a special guest contributor offers a correction about indigenous resistance to fracking, and we begin a fascinating conversation on solidarity actions and anonymity amidst the news, event announcements, statements from political prisoners, and more. </p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Since the murder of Mike Brown by police on August 9th, Ferguson, Missouri has been the site of intense riots, looting, and clashes with police. In this episode, we share accounts from participants and reflections on the rebellion, as well as an analysis which unpacks the designation of "outside agitators." Two texts discussing other recent anti-police uprisings appear on the Chopping Block, while supporters of Luke O'Donovan update us on his trial and how to show solidarity. Clara and Alanis share a slew of listener feedback, exploring the origins of the term feminism, correcting some mistakes about the IWW, and getting into a testy debate over the politics of sports. News, prisoner birthdays, Contradictionary terms, and upcoming events round out another packed episode.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>What is anarcha-feminism, and what contribution has it made to both feminism and anarchism? In this episode we kick off a series exploring anarcha-feminism in the past and present. After framing the issue and dealing with some thorny questions around definitions of feminism and gender, we take a whirlwind tour through the history--or herstory, if you like--of anarchist women from the barricades of the Paris Commune to the front lines of the Spanish Civil War. In addition to Louise Michel, Lucy Parsons, Emma Goldman, and a few other big names, we'll share stories of Russian nihilists, Puerto Rican tobacco workers, Japanese journalists, Mexican guerrillas, and many other unsung heroines of late 19th and early 20th century anarchist struggles. The anthology Quiet Rumors: An Anarcha-Feminist Reader appears on the Chopping Block, and a member of the Revolutionary Anarcha-Feminist Group from Dublin, Ireland joins us for an interview. Clara and Alanis even take issue with a term from the Contradictionary, along with a packed calendar of upcoming events, news, and more.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>The recent World Cup prompted widespread protests across Brazil. In our 25th episode, we discuss why these protests took place, who participated, and how they connected to the uprisings of the last year. We share an audio collage of protest voices, an interview with Brazilian anarchists, and a Situationist-inspired critique of mass sports spectacles. The new green anarchist journal Black Seed appears on the Chopping Block, while a Ukrainian anarchist offers perspective on why things may not be so bleak there for anarchists as we thought. And there's hooliganism, a June 11th rundown, prisoner updates, reflections on the "global village," and Juggalos to boot!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>From the incendiary writings of The Invisible Committee prompting arrests on charges of rail line sabotage in France, to the calculated analysis of Theorie Communiste and Aufheben, we may have skipped a few things in our previous two episodes about communism. The current known as communization emerged out of the struggles of May '68 in France, and to this day the question remains: can we enact communism ourselves, here and now? In this episode of the Ex-worker, we'll take another angle on communism, away from the backstabbing, newspaper-hocking, withering-state-types profiled in Episodes 20 and 21, instead focusing on those who share our dream of breaking with the misery of our conditions and dismantling this world (even if they still talk like Marxists.) In this episode we experiment with different ways of breaking through some of the heavy theoretical language and ideas, including a reportback from a rather unusual Endnotes reading group, and transmit a theme segment from an autonomous, anonymous podcasting cell. We'll travel to North and South Korea in our listener feedback section, hear an interview from Anarchist prisoner Michael Kimble about prison struggle in Alabama and the importance of supporting long-term prisoners, and round it out with news and prisoner birthdays.</p>]]></description>

After we catch up on how radicals around the world celebrated it in the streets this year, we'll turn back the clock a few decades to a particularly notorious May: Paris in 1968. The strikes and riots that nearly toppled the French state—as well as the Situationist International, those Marxist-influenced art radicals whose theories influenced the uprising—are the topic of our main feature for this episode. One of the key texts coming from the Situationist tradition, Raoul Vaneigem's The Revolution of Everyday Life, appears on the Chopping Block. Listeners weigh in on future episodes, "Uncle Ted," and the Ukraine episode and anarchist strategy. And of course there's more news, events, prisoner birthdays, and other goodies.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Anarchism ain't what it used to be … if you search iTunes or Youtube these days, you'll find defenders of capitalism and private property claiming the A word more than ever. In our 18th installment of the Ex-Worker, we kick off a two episode series discussing what anarchism <em>isn't</em>, as Clara and Alanis step in to debunk anarcho-capitalism. Surveying the range of libertarian ideologies in the US, we assess the similarities and differences between these opponents of the state and anti-capitalist anarchists, while clarifying how their free market fantasies fall short of a genuinely anarchist vision of freedom. Our critiques of private property and the free market conclude with a hilarious interview with an anarchist graphic designer about their misadventures laying out a book on "market anarchism." We also hear from recently released grand jury resister Jerry Koch about the insight he's gained into the importance of prisoner solidarity to anarchist struggle, while his lawyer explains how grand juries are used as tools of political repression and how we can resist them. Listeners offer corrections, suggestions, and updates on prisoner struggles, while plenty of news updates and announcements round out our longest episode yet!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>As we complete this episode, trial is about to begin for the NATO 3, Chicago anarchists facing domestic terrorism charges after being entrapped by informants during a 2012 protest summit. To understand the case and its context, the Ex-Worker explores the state's strategy to repress anarchists and social movements through the use of conspiracy charges and entrapment. We interview three activists from the front lines of anti-repression work: a member of the NATO 3 support team, a volunteer with the animal liberation counter-information collective Bite Back, and an anarchist supporter of the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation. Our review on the Chopping Block examines Green is the New Red: An Insider's Account of a Social Movement Under Siege while more listeners write in to share what anarchism means to them. News across the world includes anarchist typhoon relief efforts, Indiana prisoner resistance, and Christian anarchists striking back against sexism. A brief discussion by political prisoner Veronza Bowers, Jr. about repression against the Black Panther Party and an announcement from an organizer with Everglades Earth First! round out one of our most action-packed episodes to date.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In our first-ever holiday special, Clara and Alanis take a whirlwind tour through two hundred years of blistering anarchist critiques of religion and morality. From romantic poets to guillotined dynamite artists, from Enlightenment philosophers to punk rockers, anarchists have never been so fiery as when they've denied the gods and affirmed our right to determine our own values. The discussion touches on direct actions against religion, the shifting politics of atheism, and the contradictions of Christian anarchism. Prison rebel Sean Swain responds to our episode on fascism, a murderous police department receives some crime stopping tips, and we offer anarchist reflections on Nelson Mandela's legacy, decapitated Lenin statues, and Finnish hockey riots. As the Greeks say: Merry Crisis and Happy New Fear!</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Alanis and Clara allegedly break into an abandoned building to begin a conversation about squatting--and why it's so important to anarchists. This episode includes two interviews--one with participants in a squatted social center in the United States, and one from an anti-infrastructure land occupation project in France. We'll also hear the soothing sounds of listener feedback, regarding our last episode and some further clarifications about technology, a review of Hannah Dobbz's "Nine-tenths of the Law: Property and resistance in the United States," news, upcoming events, and prisoner birthdays.</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Some radicals believe the internet prefigures a decentralized utopia; others foresee a new digital feudalism of total management and surveillance. In this episode, Clara and Alanis take on the recent CrimethInc. feature "Deserting the Digital Utopia," teasing out some of the limitations and possibilities of resistance that engages with digital technologies. A supporter of imprisoned radical hacker Jeremy Hammond discusses his case. Listeners lambast us on our grievous gaffe from last episode, sketchy cops and masked marchers populate the news, and we announce an anarchist primer competition (even if we can't agree on how to pronounce it).</p>]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[<p>Anarchist resistance to fascism has a long and colorful history. Our second episode on anti-fascism looks into how anarchists fought against Franco in the Spanish Revolution and beyond. We share an exciting interview with Occupied London about fascism and resistance in Greece, as well as a Free Speech FAQ to help anti-fascists circumvent civil libertarian defenses of fascist organizing. A special guest contributor chips in with a set of lively anti-fascist movie reviews. Listeners offer more antifa updates and crucial ways to get involved, alongside news of riots, blockades, and so much more.</p>]]></description>

In this episode, we analyze contemporary fascism and the resistance anarchists have mounted to it, including the history of Anti-Racist Action. Interviews with the One People's Project and New York City Anarchist Black Cross discuss the extreme right in the US today, tactics for fighting fascists, and the Tinley Park case.
