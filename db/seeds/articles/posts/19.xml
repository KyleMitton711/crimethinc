    <content_encoded><![CDATA[For those who haven't heard already, the four remaining <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Backfire_%28FBI%29">Operation Backfire</a> defendants (aside from the fugitives) who have consistently refused to inform for the government have accepted a plea agreement in which they plead guilty but under no obligation to inform on anyone but themselves. Their suggested sentences range from five to eight years, but they could still receive up to twenty more years under so-called "anti-terror" rules, so it remains critical that they continue to receive support. These defendants could not have taken their guilty pleas in a more principled way; their courage stands as an example for us all.

      <wp_comment_content><![CDATA[It certainly does.. I mean these are people who chose to use their voices to stand up for the enviroment ... animal activists for crikey's sake.. and now being unjustly imprisoned?
 I have a theory.. you see I think we use the word "Humane" in the wrong context. I see all these atrocities us "HUMANS" cause, our carelessness with the earth and with  each other.. and I think to myself.. "it's totally humane".  It's totally humane to wrongly imprison animal activists, the guildford five incident was totally humane,  wars started for oil and money.. all of these I see and I say they are humane.
 I just went off on a tangent and I'm not sure it makes much sense to anyone but me but there it is.]]></wp_comment_content>
