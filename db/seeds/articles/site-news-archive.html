    <h1 class="p-name">New Feature on Anarchism in Colombia, 2007 Convergence in Athens, OH</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        One of our field teams recently returned from an investigative trip to Latin America, and we&rsquo;re pleased to present their complete report on anarchism and social struggles in Colombia. In addition to a general analysis of the Colombian context, this includes reports on the activities of a dozen collectives, reviews of publications from throughout the area, and contacts for a wide range of groups. Whether you&rsquo;re planning a trip to Latin America, looking to make connections for solidarity projects, or just interested in learning more about the Colombian situation, please have a look.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;re also excited to announce that this summer&rsquo;s CrimethInc. convergence will take place in Athens, Ohio from July 25 to 29. This is the most advance notice we&rsquo;ve given for a convergence since the first one, and we&rsquo;d like to think that this indicates increasingly sophisticated levels of organization on our part. Last summer&rsquo;s convergence was easily the most successful since 2002, and this summer&rsquo;s will be an excellent opportunity to share skills and adventures with your fellow hooligans and lunatics, not to mention lay plans for the year ahead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumor has it that there will also be tours leading up to the convergence; stay tuned for more details about those and the events planned for Athens. In the meantime, email crimethincbooking@yahoo.com to volunteer to contribute to, assist with, or attend the convergence.

    <h1 class="p-name">Rolling Thunder #4 Hits the Streets!</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        The fourth and best yet issue of Rolling Thunder, our direct action and resistance culture biannual, is fresh from the printers. The centerpiece of this one is a full-color photoessay chronicling the popular uprising during which the people of Oaxaca, Mexico wrested control of their city from the government for a period of months. Continuing that theme, other feature articles cover the defense and eviction of South Central Farm in Los Angeles, the Really Really Free Market as a model for reclaiming public space from capitalism and bureaucracy, the resurgence of squatting in Buffalo of all places, the university occupation movement in France, and the ins and outs of urban exploration. The remainder of the issue includes a comprehensive guide to supporting prisoners and defendants, the lyrics to &ldquo;The Big Rock Candy Mountain&rdquo; as interpreted by acclaimed comic artist Nate Powell, a gallery of ready-to-use stencils, and plenty of the edgy artwork and poignant prose you&rsquo;ve come to expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        To celebrate this issue&rsquo;s debut, we&rsquo;re sharing the report on the Really Really Free Market in our features section. If your community doesn&rsquo;t yet have a Really Really Free Market, read this introductory guide and consider starting one up this coming spring. We feel it&rsquo;s one of the most effective new anarchist organizing models of the past few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, Rolling Thunder now has its own postal address.

    <h1 class="p-name">Filastine CD Benefit for Green Scare Defendants, Downloads Galore</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        A year ago today the despicable lackeys of the FBI initiated &ldquo;operation backfire,&rdquo; a roundup of accused arsonists intended to intimidate all associated with ecologically-oriented direct action. Most the of the defendants in this witch hunt have since accepted plea bargains&mdash;some honorably, some dishonorably. More on this here.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are pleased to do our humble part to support the defendants who have refused to inform by releasing Filastine&rsquo;s &quot;Burn It&quot; CD as a fundraiser. Filastine, a former member of &iexcl;Tchkung! and founding participant in the Infernal Noise Brigade, has been drawing on musical traditions from all around the globe to compose incendiary anarchist music for well over a decade now. &quot;Burn It,&quot; a wide-ranging m&eacute;lange of driving rhythms, electronic experimentation, on-site sampling, and multilingual vocals, has already been released in Europe to great acclaim. A full $5 from every CD sale will go to the defendants, who face long stretches of prison time and massive debts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, while things seemed quiet here over the past month and a half, a full six new designs have been announced on the CrimethInc. Worker Bulletin Board. These include N30: The Seattle WTO Protests, a 64-page retrospective exploring how the WTO demonstrations seven years ago changed the course of history; a timeline of events in Oaxaca, chronicling the popular uprising currently taking place just beyond the US border; Don&rsquo;t Talk to the Police, an admonition to all who may be questioned by police or federal agents; Wash Your Own Dishes, an explication of every political/economic system from Libertarianism to Anarcho-Primitivism according to how the dishes get washed; The Art of Politics, an analysis of all the ways politics-as-we-know-it excludes, segregates, co-opts, distracts, controls, represses, and oppresses; and White Shark Tales, a globe-trotting adventure story of anarchist resistance. These are all available for downloading free of charge; please copy, plagiarize, reinvent, and circulate widely. If you cannot otherwise obtain print copies of them, email crimethincbooking@yahoo.com.

        Also, we&rsquo;ve sold out of the first printing of Raegan Butcher&rsquo;s Stone Hotel. While we may reprint it in the future, we&rsquo;re making it available as a PDF in the meantime. Reading books on a computer screen is bad enough, but this will have to do for now.

      <p>
        We&rsquo;re delighted to unveil our latest project, the CrimethInc. Worker Bulletin Board. This website will function as a clearinghouse for bulletins from participating CrimethInc. cells, enabling readers to keep abreast of their activities and, more importantly, coordinate activities with them. Announcements of upcoming events, proposals for future projects, appeals for participation and assistance, breaking news, eyewitness reports and analysis, new texts, and drafts in progress will all appear here.

        The convergence in Winona went fabulously, by far our best such effort since 2002. You can read about it on the aforementioned Bulletin Board.

        Also, in honor of the third issue of Rolling Thunder being sent off to the printer, we&rsquo;re leaking an article from it in advance: &ldquo;The Irrepressible Anarchists,&rdquo; a discussion of the latest wave of federal repression sweeping our communities and the most effective ways we can respond.

        The convergence plans that have been incubating since winter have hatched! You&rsquo;ll find here an extensive description of what to expect, including campsite policies, activities, and scheduled events. This is by far the most preparation we&rsquo;ve ever done for one of these events. This summer&rsquo;s CrimethInc. convergence runs from July 26 to 31. Those who wish to attend should show up during the day on July 26 to the Visitors Center on the northeast corner of Highway 61 and Huff Street in Winona, Minnesota. Email convergence@crimethinc.com with questions. See you there, or somewhere . . .

        Thanks to everyone for the immense support we received after our announcement of financial crisis. The abundance of supportive words and donations sustained us through a very difficult time, and we've emerged on the other side intact and ready for action. All who lent a hand have our most sincere gratitude. As such, we're pleased as punch to announce that the extraordinary crisis is over and we now resume our constant-but-not-quite-debilitating financial crisis. Fighting For Our Lives are once again shipping out in bulk, and you can ignore our desperate pleas for donations without guilt once again! Just kidding, of course&mdash;donations still remain an essential element to what we are doing and if you are able to spare some money to help us send out FFOLs, it is still needed and appreciated. And finally, if you've been thinking about grabbing a copy of the Ne Plus Ultra Days of War, time is running out, as of today only 11 copies remain.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        We're thrilled to relay that in the first seven weeks after announcing the availability of the third printing of Fighting For Our Lives, we have received more than one thousand requests for free copies; at the same time we are chagrined to report that donations are at an all time low, and numerous other factors have contributed to our first-ever full-blown financial crisis (to the degree where we cannot currently send out any free copies of FFOL due to lack of funds). We've posted a report on the situation, and have included some suggestions for how you can help if you have a few extra dollars and feel the work we&rsquo;re doing is worth supporting. Towards that end, we have a special Ne Plus Ultra Edition of Days of War, Nights of Love&mdash;a hardcover pressing limited to one hundred copies celebrating the book's tenth printing and fifth anniversary (both of which actually occurred about nine months ago&mdash;we've been busy -Ed.). We will be sending out a total of fifty copies as tokens of our appreciation for people who make donations of $100 or more (details here). Thanks so much&mdash;for all the support everyone has given to bring our collective effort this far, and for your consideration in the present situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've been working around the clock sorting proposals for this summer's convergence, trying to put everything in place. We're still looking for people to share skills and stories&mdash;we&rsquo;d love to hear from those who experienced mutual aid following hurricane Katrina, participants in the CPE riots in France and undocumented immigrant struggles in the US, local organizers who have hit upon particularly effective schemes, and just about everyone else. If you&rsquo;re interested in bottom-lining a project or presentation, please email us with your plans; you can also download a promotional poster. As summer begins to heat up, at least one tour will set out for the convergence. In the meantime, you can keep up with the ongoing Requiem tour here.

      <p>
        This summer, the fifth CrimethInc. convergence will take place in Winona, Minnesota from July 26 to 31. A core group of locals will work hard all summer to prepare the ground so this event can both contribute to the host community and enable participants from around the world to trade tactics and forge connections. Click here for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other news, to honor and assist those working to make their neighborhoods safer and more welcoming, we have printed a new sticker identifying Community Watch Areas and discouraging police activity within them. Please apply these as part of a larger program of promoting accountability among community members as well as resisting the encroachments of occupying armies. In conjunction with these stickers, we now have a page given over entirely to the study of the lowest form of life, the law enforcement agent.
      </p>
      <p>
        And last, but certainly not least, we&rsquo;re thrilled to announce that CrimethInc. Far East is leaving Olympia, its home for these past five years, and moving back to delightful downtown Salem, Oregon. The ancient among you will remember a Salem PO Box on the first issue of Harbinger, and we're excited to be moving back to the city that played host to our first bits of real living. We'll be moving at the beginning of May and don't anticipate more than very minor delays in day-to-day operations including sending out orders and FFOL requests. Any mail sent after May 1st should be directed to our new mailing address. We believe in the potential of this sleepy little town on the Willamette, and hope through the next years to help Salem realize its great radical potential as we realize our own. Thanks Olympia, Hello Salem!

    <h1 class="p-name">Fighting For Our Lives Available Once More, Ten Year Report, Mayday Poster</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        Today, April Fool&rsquo;s Day, 2006, we announce the third printing of our anarchist primer Fighting For Our Lives, which is once again available from us free in bulk throughout North America. This printing of 150,000 brings the total print run of this pamphlet to 500,000 copies, the target we set for this project three and a half years ago. This latest edition is by far the best looking, with two colors throughout and several other format improvements. Please order as many copies as you think there might be readers in your community&mdash;let&rsquo;s keep the anarchist alternative in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        A half million copies of a paper is a lot in some circles, but in our eyes, this is the very least we can do. We would like to see a similar level of activity from all other anarchist groups, whether that takes the form of outreach, artistic expression, community infrastructure, labor organizing, mass mobilizations, sabotage, or other means of struggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;ve taken advantage of this occasion to compile a report on the past decade of CrimethInc. activity, painstakingly prepared by CrimethInc. Far East in association with other CWC operatives. This report chronicles some of the projects that have appeared during this period and suggests some lessons that can be derived from these ten years of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, just in time to help promote local events celebrating the coming of spring and the memory of the Haymarket martyrs, we&rsquo;ve finished a new Mayday poster, which is now available for downloading.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        The new issue of Rolling Thunder is out! The lengthiest articles this time around are an analysis of last summer&rsquo;s protests against the G8 meeting in Scotland, a retrospective on squatting and resistance culture in northern Europe, and an in-depth discussion of subcultural marginality and refusal that is to dropping out what last issue&rsquo;s sixteen-page feature article was to protest activism. The last of these is rounded out by an inside report on the workings of current labor unions, a memoir of gender mutiny, and an account of how to establish a squatted community center; other highlights include an intimate reflection on the patterns by which abusive relationships perpetuate themselves and a primer on communications technology for direct action. This issue also features plenty of the unorthodox fare that distinguishes CrimethInc. projects from the sometimes listless work of other radicals: a haunting fairy tale, cutting edge games to play between more serious adventures, a crossword puzzle, and sheet music for a classic blues song about the preponderance of bread products in the dumpsterer&rsquo;s diet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we are pleased to announce that the Urban Pirates cell of the CrimethInc. network has unveiled a new website, urbanpirates.crimethinc.net. Among other services, this resource provides information about and downloads from many bands associated with CrimethInc.&mdash;such as Requiem and The Spectacle, who will tour the US together from May through July. To help with booking this tour, email Stef (at) crimethinc.com; the tour dates will appear on the aforementioned website.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        We've just returned from the printer with 20,000 copies of our latest free newspaper, A Civilian's Guide to Direct Action: What It Is, What It's Good For, How It Works. This step-by-step guide covers every stage in direct action organizing from brainstorming to post-action legal support. It is a perfect companion piece for our anarchist cookbook, Recipes for Disaster, in that it offers a general framework for applying the specific skills detailed in that book. Whether you're engaging in civil disobedience, articipating in a mass mobilization, or carrying out hard-core sabotage, this can serve as a checklist from the beginning to the end. The paper also includes refutations of all the clich&eacute;s that regularly trotted out by those who oppose direct action.
      </p>
      <p>
        This newspaper comes free in every order from CrimethInc. Far East, and is also available in bulk for less than the cost of printing and postage. Two bundles of it have been added to the Literature Distro Kit without the cost of the latter increasing one penny, and a pdf is available here for downloading. Please join us in this educational campaign to keep direct action as safe, effective, and popular as possible.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        I'm tickled to announce that after months of hard labour and a rather steep learning curve, our first of hopefully many DVD projects, CrimethInc. Guerilla Film Series, Volume One, is now available. Spanning two discs, the collection combines our old standards (Pickaxe and Breaking the Spell) with a new feature documentary (The Miami Model) and five short films (three classic thinktank experiments documented and two SubMedia films). We also hammered out subtitles in English and Spanish for all three features, and added new filmmaker commentaries for Pickaxe, BTS, and the thinktank film, Auto Revision. Check out the trailer and if you feel so inclined, grab a copy for $10ppd and show it to as many people as possible. The DVD is also included in the now slightly improperly-named Literature Distro Kit.
      </p>
      <p>
        As fucking excited as we are to have this DVD fnished and available, we are equally dispirited by the immenent increase in postal rates on January 8th. Despite the official line of a &quot;slight increase of 5.4%,&quot; Media Mail rates are increasing by as much as 13%. Because everything we publish has the postage for Media Mail built into the price, an increase this large makes life even more difficult for us&mdash;for several of our books this is the second or third increase in postage costs since we set the prices over the last few yers. To help compensate, we are going to add 1% to our online surcharge, but otherwise we're sticking it out and not increasing any of our prices. We're giving fair warning: with the next rate increase we may very well have to increase some prices.

        After years and years of failed attempts and results so horrendous as to boggle the mind, we open for public participation the newest attempt at a CrimethInc. networking site, CrimethInc.Net/work 2.0. There are a lot of bells and whistles here&mdash;an events calendar, a cell directory, user blogs, a recipe database, art galleries&mdash;all of which are begging for content created by you.

(Holding these finished projects in my hand, I'm reminded of why we started doing all this in the first place&mdash;this music makes me want to stay alive. -Ed.) Click on the above links for more info and mp3 samples, and catch them together on their European tour, after which Requiem will be touring the US starting mid-October.

      <p>
        Also, after a long absence we've finally reprinted the DIY Guide 2/Walls Are Alive Combo Zine, and it is now available again in bulk. We've cut 12 pages from the DIY Guide that were covered in more depth in the cookbook, but the other 40 pages are still there, as well the complete The Walls Are Alive. The price, unfortunately, has to stay the same despite the fewer pages due to enormous increases in paper prices over the last year. The Combo Zines are also now included in the Literature Distro Kit.

    <h1 class="p-name">New and Improved Cookbook Printing</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        Fresh off the presses, the second printing of our anarchist cookbook, Recipes for Disaster, printed by a new printer in Quebec, has arrived. The new edition boasts some small improvements over the first edition, the most significant of which is the fancy, new PUR glue used in the binding. PUR glue is more than ten times stronger than normal book-binding glue so the book itself will not fall apart, even under heavy abuse, as well as being resistant to heat (so it won't melt), resistant to below freezing temperatures (so it won't crack), and most importantly, it makes the spine extraordinarily flexible so that it resists creasing and enables the book to be laid flat easily and without doing any damage. This was one of the few complaints we received about the first printing, and we're glad to be able to make it right. Additionally, the book is now printed on chlorine-free, 100% post-consumer recycled paper, and is printed at an union print shop (not an easy thing to find). Oh, and finally, we fixed a few typos and added a small update or two (yes, this means you, Mr. Chertoff). Starting today, all orders for the cookbook will be sent out copies from this second printing.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        Our latest experiment, the Adventurist Convergence, occurs this week in Bloomington, Indiana between July 14 and 18. To participate, simply show up at the Monroe County Public Library (303 E. Kirkwood Ave. Bloomington, IN 47408) on Thursday (July 14); an agent there will redirect you to the campsite. If you&rsquo;ll be arriving at another time, or have any other needs or questions, email crimethincbooking@yahoo.com. Volunteers are urged to come early to help prepare the campsite and assist in other ways. We also still need help providing food for everyone, gathering gifts to offer at Saturday&rsquo;s Really Really Free Market, and doing just about everything else.

        Requiem has just finished recording their upcoming album, Storm Heaven, which will be released in August along with the new album by their sister band, The Spectacle. You can download a Requiem song here; for a foretaste of the forthcoming Spectacle recording and a listing of all the dates the two bands will play together on their joint tour of Europe from August to October, visit www.the-spectacle.com. Before and after that tour, Requiem will tour the US; for a listing of those shows, click here.

    <h1 class="p-name">First Issue of New Journal, New Raegan Butcher Book, Convergence Update</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        If anything has been missing from our publishing regimen, it has been a regular periodical to provide continuity from one project to the next and cover the adventures these projects bring about. At long last, we are pleased to present Rolling Thunder, an &ldquo;anarchist journal of dangerous living&rdquo; that will fill this role. This debut issue includes an extensive analysis of the past decade of direct action, feature articles on consent in sexual relationships and alternative conceptions of education, and testimonials from maniacs who squatted their own workplaces and set themselves on fire while fighting police . . . and that&rsquo;s just the beginning! Written, designed, and printed through the same channels as our books, this magazine offers 116 pages of radical commentary, history, poetry, artwork, fiction, parlor games, comics, skills, culinary advice, and other inflammatory material.
      </p>
      <p>
        As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, we&rsquo;ve also just received from the printer the fourth book in the CrimethInc. Letters series, a new collection of poetry by Raegan Butcher entitled Rusty String Quartet. It picks up where Stone Hotel left off, as Raegan is released from prison into a world seven years different from the one he knew. This isn&rsquo;t the poetry they made you read in high school, that&rsquo;s for sure. Our second longest book to date, Rusty String Quartet offers 264 poems in 340 pages. Both new titles are also now included in the Literature Distro Kit.
      </p>
      <p>
        We now have a page up providing information about the CrimethInc. convergence taking place in Indiana this summer July 14-18. As we attempt to coordinate events for the week, it will be tremendously helpful for those interested to get in touch and let us know what projects, presentations, resources, or desires they intend to bring. Some of the organizers can be contacted through crimethincbooking@yahoo.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, this summer we will release The Spectacle&rsquo;s second album and the first recording by Requiem. Both bands will tour Europe together in September and October, and Requiem will tour the US in August and November. Anyone willing to book a show&mdash;or, even better, do the work to ensure that a given show is more than just another show&mdash;can contact them through that same address, crimethincbooking@yahoo.com.

        There will be a CrimethInc. convergence this summer! It will take place in Indiana, from July 14 to 18. The campsite is yet to be ascertained, but the convergence will intersect with the Plan-It-X Records festival in Bloomington on July 16: the day will be filled with workshops and games, and the evening with music and other excitement. We're really pulling out all the stops for this convergence, and we urge all of you to pull together a traveling group, brainstorm some resource or secret plan that you are more qualified than any other to bring and offer to your fellow maniacs, and join us to make it something unforgettable.
      </p>

        For all those who have eagerly been anticipating the upcoming Sabatour in support of Recipes for Disaster, you can help out by sending in much-needed donations. The organization is in its final hour, and the dates are posted on the informational site. Dozens and dozens of strangers have come together to make this tour possible, and they all deserve thanks for their efforts and investment. Also, anyone in the new england area with a van that would like to come on the tour is offically welcome. We invite freight drivers/renegade performers for an adevnture of a lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly, we have new Literature Distro Kits now available: the new kits include everything you need to set up a distro table or stock a small infoshop including books to sell and zines, posters and stickers in bulk to give away. We made these available so that people can get bulk copies of all the books at the cheapest possible price without having to order 10 copies of each book.

        We have a new 7&rdquo; from Zegota, and it&rsquo;s some of their best music ever! The first side is an unabashed street protest anthem entitled &ldquo;Anarchist Cheerleader Song,&rdquo; and the other a spine-tingling cover of the traditional spiritual &ldquo;Sinner Man&rdquo; &aacute; la Nina Simone. Like all their best material, these songs veer between catchy and haunting, remaining impassioned and frenetic throughout. Our condolences to those who missed Zegota on their US tour a month ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        There&rsquo;s a new article up in our features section, a preview from the forthcoming first issue of our wild-eyed adventurist periodical Rolling Thunder: it&rsquo;s an extensive account and analysis of the past few years of militant demonstrations, aimed to sharpen the wits and tactics of the direct action movement in North America. Speaking of magazines, we now have a &lsquo;zine-format PDF available of &ldquo;Wasted, Indeed,&rdquo; the anarchist indictment of alcohol that first appeared in the now out-of-print final issue of our hardcore journal, Inside Front. We also have a new poster in the downloads section: &ldquo;Behind Our Masks, We Are You.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;ll have copies of that poster, among other incendiary (and mostly free!) materials, at our tables at the 10th Annual San Francisco Anarchist Book Fair on the 26th of this month. In early April, Requiem will play a few shows in the Midwest, including at the Global Conference in Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 9. Contact them at crimethincbooking@yahoo.com and demand they play in your community.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;re into the last fifth of the first printing of Recipes for Disaster, and will be reprinting it in late April, around the time the first issue of Rolling Thunder finally sees the light of day. Shortly thereafter, we&rsquo;ll release a new full-length from Norway&rsquo;s The Spectacle. More about this coming summer in the next update.

    <h1 class="p-name">Our Anarchist Cookbook, Recipes For Disaster, Is Unleashed Upon the World</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        For ten long years, our operatives have honed their skills, testing their wits and mettle against the global capitalist empire, the most formidable adversary in the history of life on earth. We have learned how to redecorate the walls of cities occupied by armies of riot police, to transform random groups of damaged, isolated individuals into loving communities capable of supporting one another through the most severe bouts of repression and depression, to shut down corporate summits and franchises armed with little more than plastic piping or eyedroppers of glue. Now, we&rsquo;ve compiled many of the techniques that made these feats possible into a 624-page handbook entitled Recipes for Disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sixty-two recipes run the gamut from Affinity Groups to Wheatpasting, stopping along the way at topics as disparate as Hitchhiking, Sabotage, and Supporting Survivors of Domestic Violence. Each recipe is illustrated as necessary with photographs, technical diagrams, and firsthand accounts. Countless individuals and collectives have contributed to the testing, composing, and editing, in order to put the most useful and comprehensive manual in the hands of revolutionaries everywhere. Recipes for Disaster has not yet been banned by the U.S. government; it is currently available from us for not much more than the costs of printing, and transportation. We hope this book will help those working to transform both their own lives and the world as we know it, but the rest is up to you. The first 500 mailorder copies will receive a nice little bookmark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our features section has also been updated with a text on direct action, the focus of Recipes for Disaster.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        We&rsquo;ve nearly run out of copies of the second printing of Fighting For Our Lives, our introduction to passionate anarchism, and can no longer offer them for bulk orders. That makes close to 350,000 of them that have been distributed since the paper was first published in September 2002. We hope to do another printing eventually, but for the time being we are financially crippled to an extent that makes the average North American working family look solvent. We were able to pull off the first printing of Fighting For Our Lives, barely, thanks to the massive donations that many offered to assist with this project, but the donations for this printing have been fewer and much less, and we&rsquo;re barely able to afford to mail out paid orders at this point. If any of you have the financial means to assist us, so we can keep the greater part of our projects free to the public and donation-based, this is the time to do so. Thanks for all the support we have received over the years. Bulk copies are still available for special events and occasions, if you have a plan cooking, just drop us a line.

        And now, the biggest news here since the publication of Fighting for Our Lives! After nearly three years of hard labor, our anarchist cookbook, Recipes for Disaster, has finally entered the production process. This 624-page book collects a great part of the skills and knowledge direct action enthusiasts have developed and tested over the past decade, covering everything from Affinity Groups to Wheatpasting; well over thirty different collectives have collaborated to produce it, and we hope it can play an important part in equipping our communities for the next decade of activity. The books should be back from the printers and in our hands around December 15, check back here then for all the details. We can't accept pre-orders, as we have no idea what will happen to them, us, or you between now and then, but in the meantime, click here for a characteristically grandiose preview.

      </p>
      <p>
        A quick update on the poster kit projects: This weekend we did new reprintings of all three posters (third for 'Gender,' second for both 'Beauty' and 'Regime'), so it appears folks are excited and motivated by them&mdash;at this point we have put more than 100,000 out into the world&mdash;hooray! Sadly, the cost of the fancy paper we use for the posters has gone up considerbaly over the last year since we first made them available, and with this most current printing we are forced to raise the prices by about 50&cent; a bundle to keep up with costs ($4ppd for a bundle of 25, $25ppd for 250).

        At long last, after a full three years of setbacks and catastrophes, we have released the complete discography of recordings by the fastest, fiercest, most feral, and most Finnish band in the history of destructive anarchist blastbeat punk, &Uuml;mlaut. This unauthorized bootleg discography features all 38 of their recorded songs, still clocking in at under half an hour, and includes an 80-page book collecting lyrics, incendiary liner notes, absurdist interviews, words to unrecorded songs, apocryphal comic book illustrations, and other nonsense and debauchery. From their inaccessible, hyperspeed aesthetics to their nihilistic, quasi-terrorist politics, this is not a record you should leave out for your parents or children to stumble across. Oh ye of little faith, download a song or three to find out just how little we&rsquo;re joking.

        As the smoke from the enormous burning dragon puppet clears and felony charges are reduced to misdemeanors, the massive protests in New York City are settling into perspective as evidence that the direct action movement in the US didn&rsquo;t die three years ago. For a report from the most radical contingent in the march of half a million people on August 29, proceed to www.dontjustvote.com. To obtain bulk copies of the latest paper published by the Don&rsquo;t Just Vote underground, It&rsquo;s Not Bush, It&rsquo;s the System, email info@dontjustvote.com or mail a postage donation to Don&rsquo;t Just Vote Mailroom, P.O. Box 2133, Greensboro, NC 27402. For a report on the CrimethInc. convergence in Des Moines, Iowa the week before the demonstrations in New York City, proceed here.

        First, we're thrilled to announce the release of Rope or Guillotine, the first full length recording by Norwegian hardcore band The Spectacle. Admittedly, some of us older folks in the record label department here are jaded about much punk music, so it's really exciting for us to have discovered a new band that makes our hearts beat faster&mdash;let alone for us to get to put out a record by them! All the passion, fury, and soaring beauty we treasured in Gehenna, Zegota, Undying, Catharsis, and Godspeed! You Black Emperor are here in abundance, and The Spectacle both live up to those comparisons and pick up where they leave off. Don't take our word for it, though&mdash;download a low-fi mp3 of one of their songs and hear for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Spectacle and Requiem will be touring the eastern US together between October and November. If anyone is willing to book shows or otherwise assist this project, please email crimethincbooking@yahoo.com.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new printing of Fighting For Our Lives is steadily making its way out of the warehouse space. As usual, we must emphasize that it is only possible for us to do all this free literature distribution on the strength of the donations we receive, so if you think this is important please help us make it possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CrimethInc. convergence in Des Moines is swiftly approaching. If you plan on attending, please contact the organizers at heldhostage68@hotmail.com and let them know when you will arrive, how many people are traveling with you, and if you can provide or are in need of a ride to the Republican National Convention in New York City. Speaking of that convention, all who plan on attending should read the call to action now posted on www.dontjustvote.com.

    <h1 class="p-name">Fighting For Our Lives Reprinted, Summer Plans Unveiled, Website Redesign</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        A year and a half after we ran out of the first 250,000 of our introductory anarchist paper Fighting For Our Lives, we've finally borrowed enough money to print another 100,000 copies. As before, quixotic as it may be, we're making this available to the public at large free in any quantity. Please be judicious in deciding how many to order, so there will be enough to go around, at least for a little while--but please do order copies and spread them throughout your community! These are perfect for giving out outside Michael Moore's new documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, at the upcoming protests at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, at the public library, anywhere people are hungry for freedom and looking for a direction to set out after it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As before, this project is costing us a lot of money. In a capitalist economy, what happens is determined by the dictates of the ruthless &quot;free market&quot;; in an anarchist economy, what happens is dictated by desire alone; unfortunately, even at our best, we exist somewhere between the two, so in order to help us make this project free for those without resources we humbly ask that those with them, who feel it is worthwhile, take the trouble to make a donation.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also time to announce our plans for the summer. Several tours associated with the CrimethInc. global underground will be taking place through July and early August; one of these, the Total Liberation Tour, featuring speakers, hardcore and hip hop acts, and an emphasis on animal rights and direct action, will cross the entire United States between July 7 and 25. Immediately following that, from July 26 to 29, the Democratic National Convention will take place in Boston, Massachusetts. This will be followed by two convergences to which CrimethInc. agents and functionaries are invited. The first is the North American Anarchist Convergence in Athens, Ohio, from August 12 to 15; all who attend are encouraged to bring a brief performance piece to share at a surprise entertainment event being planned in secret at this very moment. The second will be in Des Moines, Iowa from August 20 to 26, as announced earlier on this site. Shortly thereafter, the political party that currently purports to rule the world will gather for the Republican National Convention in New York City, from August 30 to September 4.
      </p>
      <p>
        We propose that radicals from the east coast gather in Athens, then proceed to the city to get familiar with it, while folks from the west coast and midwest gather at the Des Moines convergence, and travel east from there. Whatever happens, it's going to make&mdash;or break&mdash;history. Don't miss out on the chance to be part of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        As many of you have surely noticed, there has been a complete redesign of this website. Hopefully you will find it easier to navigate, locate specific information more directly, and finally be able to link to specific pages within the site (no more frames!). The page sizes have all been reduced to facilitate faster loading on slow connections, and the format has been changed so as to display well on both small and large monitors. If you'd like, please leave some feedback here, and feel free to point out any broken pages or links&mdash;there will surely be some as every single page on the site has been reworked. Thanks, and I hope y'all like it.

      <p>
        The third and newest installment of our subversion poster series is now available, the Beauty Subversion Kit, also known affectionately as the Medusa poster. Some of you may be familiar with its previous incarnation, but its back for more, bigger, fancier (yes, fancier!), and now has a corresponding back side to round out the whole 'kit' aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, and perhaps of more importance, we'd like to announce that Active Distribution in London is now carrying virtually the entire CrimethInc. catalog for distribution in Europe, including co-releasing the european edition of the Zegota Reclaim! CD and several thousand copies of the new Harbinger. We couldn't be more pleased with the partnership as they are excellent folks committed to the same goals we are, and are some of the only people around who we feel can really do CrimethInc. distro right&mdash;with their hearts in their hands and sweat on their brows. This should help make CrimethInc. material more accessible to many people, and we plan on continuing this arrangement with future releases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and by the way, we will be announcing the availability of the second printing of Fighting For Our Lives before the end of the month. Yes, you heard right. Um, speaking of, did we mention that we need donations to make this work?

        At long last, CrimethInc. Far East has moved out of the living room (and that one half of the bathroom, the back room, Lisa's parent's basement, and the strorage space) and into a warehouse space in downtown Olympia, WA. Eventually, this will be open to the public as The Crossing, a bookstore and infoshop; in the meantime, while we wrestle with building codes and so on, people can contact us to make appointments to come by and pick up literature and other material in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        This summer, between August 20 and 26, Des Moines, Iowa will host a convergence of CrimethInc. agents and all other interested parties. You're invited, of course. Transportation will be provided for those leaving this event to attend the party of a lifetime in New York City immediately thereafter. Learn more and keep up with developments here. As summer heats up, we'll unveil our plans for a few tours and another convergence. We'll have plenty of new music and literature finished soon, too.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        Firstly, we are all very excited by the overwhelmingly positive response to the release of the Sandman / The Long Walk Home CD, and such enthusiastic support certainly encourages us to consider further exploring other musical genres&mdash;so, thank you! It has made us feel warm in our little hearts to hear how much some of you love the record. Be sure to go see Sandman on his full tour of the U.S. and Canada from April 21st to June 13th, his live show is great and he will also be touring with a variety of CrimethInc. literature. There are still a few cities that he needs some help setting up a show, so please check the tour page and drop him a line if you can help. And for a glimpse into the future: Sandman will start recording a new full-length album in Minnesota after the tour, to be released many months later. We can't wait.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the mean time, our toes are thawing out in the fresh, fresh Olympia sun after a rainy and cold, cold Olympian winter. The distribution of the fifth Harbinger is going better than we could have expected, with one third of the entire print run already sent out for distribution and no sign of letting up&mdash;if you were waiting to order your copies, don't wait too long, or they'll be gone. Also, in the last month we have done the second printing of Off the Map, and the second printing of 20,000 gender posters. We have a couple of new projects planned for the summer, but we'll keep them up our sleeve for now.

    <h1 class="p-name">New Harbinger, New Feature, New Nationwide Call to Action</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        The fifth issue of our free propaganda tabloid Harbinger is finally complete, after two and a half years of hard labor on the part of the editorial board. Thematically, it begins where the last one left off, on the morning of September 11th, 2001 when the terrain of the struggle for total liberation suddenly shifted, and works from there forward to the present day. From the apocalypse that started it all and the ensuing struggles with catastrophes and feelings of failure, through crowd dynamics and the social forces that underlie them, the essential role employment plays in the system of misery (and how to desert it), and the joys of so-called extremism, to the inexorable insurrection to come&mdash;it's all in here. Please order massive quantities of it to share with your friends, family, ex-co-workers, and future co-conspirators.
      </p>
      <p>
        As faith in global capitalism and corporate democracy crumbles, it would be foolish to think that anarchy and liberation are the only other game in town. That's why we've provided this new feature, an account and analysis of direct actions recently taken against an attempted fascist rally, to share skills for those who would also like to nip in the bud bids for power on the part of racists and totalitarians.
      </p>
      <p>
        And&mdash;In concert with other anti-authoritarian groups, we are calling for a national campaign to take advantage of this election year to emphasize the power of direct action as a viable alternative to representation. This campaign will include literature, postering and stickering, demonstrations, educational events, and other forms of community outreach, both in our own communities and around the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. It will culminate in a nationwide day of direct action on November 2, election day. For now, we direct those interested to www.dontjustvote.com, at which you will find the call to action and plenty of other material on the issue.

    <h1 class="p-name">9th Annual San Francisco Anarchist Bookfair, Two New Essays</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        Some of us will be heading down to the 9th Annual San Francisco Book Fair the weekend of March 13th. We'll have the usual assortment of books, the new Sandman cd, and a whole mess of free posters and stickers. We will also debut the newest installment of a serial project that won't be announced here until after the book fair&mdash;but until then, here are two hints: it is 21,000 words long and has been two and a half years in the making. And we'll have a bunch of them. See you there!
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who haven't stumbled onto them yet, here are direct links to two new essays: Forget Terrorism: The Hijacking of Reality dealing with the events following the 9/11 attacks, and You Are Under Surveillance, about modern ceramic kitchenware.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        We've been so busy getting all this stuff together, we have no energy left for flowery descriptions, so here it is straight: 1) After running out of both, separately, we just got back a reprinting combining the DIY Guide #2 and The Walls Are Alive into one combo zine, going out free with every order, and also available in bulk. 2) We now have a third CrimethInc. Agent Subversion Sticker Kit (You Are Under Surveillance), made for deployment everywhere. 3) A new, huge, full-color poster is available for a mass wheat-pasting campaign featuring the dark shadows cast by the events following 9/11. We've also lowered the cost of Priority Mail and started using some fancy shipping labels.
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly, we have a bit of a surprise called The Long Walk Home by Sandman, our first recording that is not hardcore music&mdash;hooray! Chris Sand (aka Sandman) self-released an earlier version of this album last year and it quickly became one of our favorites around the house. We made some needed changes (including lowering the price to $6 postage-paid) and are very excited to release our first country/folk record, which we hope you will enjoy. MP3 samples along with a detailed description are available here.

      <p>
        At long last, the new Zegota record, Reclaim!, is now available. I have been listening to this record a lot in the last few weeks and it has truly become one of my favorite punk records from the last few years&mdash;I think that anyone who enjoyed their previous recordings will be elated upon hearing their newest. Also, back from the dead is the old Ire CD, which after being unavailable for some time, is now back in stock. In the works right now, we have a new sticker subversion kit, a big and fancy poster, a new cd from a musical genre as-of-yet unexplored by CrimethInc., and of course, the juggernaut that has become Harbinger 5&mdash;expect announcements on these over the next month. Oh, and there is also a long overdue blog entry.

    <h1 class="p-name">New Zegota record &amp; tour with new band Requiem, report from Miami FTAA</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        We are proud to announce that the new Zegota record, Reclaim!, is complete and will soon be available from the Far East mailorder. Reclaim! is Zegota's first true album, written and conceived as such, and recorded over several days in Malm&ouml;, Sweden by David Sandstrom from the Refused. On it, they live up to every bit of promise shown in their previous recordings and performances, delivering a well-crafted forty-minute adventure constructed with the rawest of vocals, wall-like guitars, delicate piano sections, drum beats like the heartbeat of an escaped hostage and an unrestrained bass sound to bring it all together. Here is an mp3 of the 5th song on the album, Struck by the Wild (due to bandwidth concerns the mp3 is encoded at a less than premium rate to reduce file size, the actual recording quality is much higher.) As usual, the packaging is unique, organic and refined, with fine letterpress work we did ourselves on our recently acquired letterpress. Zegota will also be on an east coast tour with the newly-formed band Requiem (composed of former members of Catharsis, and we mean it this time&mdash;those who loved Catharsis will appreciate the same forces brought to bear here, of course in an entirely new way). The tour starts the 27th in NYC and goes through the 2nd.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also posted in the features section an analysis and report on the events in Miami during the FTAA conference titled BRINGING THE HEAT IN MIAMI: An Analysis of Direct Action at the November 2003 F.T.A.A. Ministerial. The article takes a critical look at the planning and organizing of the event, recounts some participants experiences during the action, and concludes with a post-script looking at race relations in the heat of battle.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        Just in the nick of time to qualify as frustratingly late, but not so late as to be totally useless, we have made a new FTAA-themed poster available in our downloads section. It is available in two-color and b&amp;w varieties, and while particularly appropriate for next weeks events in Miami, it does not reference it specifically so as to remain useful for deployment after Miami and until we finally destroy the FTAA. We are also getting a few thousand of the two-color version printed, and these will start to go out with every order in about two weeks. Also, we have added a new article in the feature section detailing the exploits of some trouble-making anarchists who helped facilitate many severe, and repeated beatings of George W. Bush on Halloween. (Secret Service and FBI motherfuckers alike, please note that the president was not harmed, nor were any plans made to harm him, nor does anyone here intend for harm to come to ol' GW.) Sorry about that disclaimer folks, but we're living in wild times.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        Before we get started, an update on a future update: we hope to have some new posters done by the time our enemies meet to work on the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement in Miami this November, we'll post them as soon as we do. In the meantime, for those interested in fucking things up for them, the features section now includes a draft in progress as a foretaste of the anarchist cookbook we'll be publishing early next year: a Black Bloc How-To. Young activists be advised, however, that the CrimethInc. officials who handle strategy and tactics have concluded that the Black Bloc approach may not be as effective in Miami as more covert, unpredictable guerrilla actions . . . so apply the Bloc recipe on Halloween night, when everyone's in masks anyway, and &quot;do your part&quot; locally, then go try out other things in Miami. That's our advice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, we're thrilled to announce the release of the &quot;Passing Times&quot; CD, a work of genius by our friends Face Down In Shit. For those of you not familiar with the band, this is soulful, poor boy stoner punk rock at its most artistically mature and emotionally intense. This album is a cry from the pit, an affirmation of life at its hardest and bleakest. Following the usual discussion about politics and so on, medical guinea pig Jason wanted me to use the phrase &quot;direct action marijuana liberation activists&quot; in their description, so there it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of our favorite Scandinavian bands, The Spectacle and Zegota, will be going on tour soon. The Spectacle will be touring Europe through November and December, and Zegota will finally be playing a week of US shows on the east coast from December 27 to January 2. There is a new blog entry also. All the best in your adventures and misadventures, my friends. Winter is coming&mdash;let's put the heat on.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        At long last, we have our inside report, Under the Helicopters, an eyewitness account of the CrimethInc. barnstorming tours convergence, the attendant media and police witch-hunt, and the usual triumph of anarchy against insurmountable odds; at the end of the piece are links to videos from two polar perspectives. We are also happy to announce that a new musical effort by the notorious east-coast aural-assaulters and hardcore-jazz fusionists Countdown To Putsch is now available. The double CD, Interventions in Hegemony, is their latest attempt to defy those who have to describe their music in short blurbs like this, and contains the usual lengthy written accompaniment in the form of a 44 page booklet, all for $10ppd. And lastly, I have been working on my own blog, entitled The Love Tale of the Hyena (crimethinc.com/hyena), as a minor add-on to this website that documents the smaller news and workings of the Olympia cell. A full description of my intent is available in the introduction, and so far I have reported on the reprinting of some books, our new letterpress, fonts, vietnam, new posters, honey badgers . . .

        that it was quite a hit at the PDX Zine Symposium, many a happy face

        away in anxious hands. Some of you may have heard rumblings from the

        are getting louder, as quite a storm is a-brewing. As soon as the
        events are over, and those guilty have dispersed and melted back into
        their communities we will post a full report of the rolling thunder. We
        have also posted a PDF of Hunter/gatherer #1 as we no longer have any

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        In case you've been out of the loop&mdash;and we wouldn't blame you if that's the case&mdash;there is this great little thing happening this summer called CrimethInc. Summer Barnstorming, and if you want to be involved, simply go to its web site and check out all the info, and itineraries. For a little background, I suggest you check out these recollections from last years tour and convergence. On a completely separate note, some of us folks from CrimethInc. Far East will be journeying down to Portland from Olympia to attend the Portland Zine Symposium. It will be on the Portland State University campus in downtown Portland from August 1-3; there will we workshops, discussions, massive tabling from the independent press, film screenings and many things I know nothing about. While some of us potentially will be involved in some workshops, feel free to stop by our table anytime and ask any questions you want about making zines, printing, writing, design, or . . . We'll have the usual books and zines to sell and give away, along with free stickers and posters, and we will be debuting a new poster/zine that will be free at the symposium, code named CrimethInc. Gender Subversion Kit #69-B. See ya there.

    <h1 class="p-name">A new book, deals, offers and requests in one big ol' update</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        The CrimethInc. Kite Flying Society strikes back! Off the Map is now available as a book! Yep, we took the plunge and truthfully we feel really great about it&mdash;hold a copy in your hand and it feels like a descion well made. Per usual, we have a nice little mini-site all about it, but here is the skinny: 146 pages, all the same text as the zine, better photos, all those lil' drawings in their full offset-press glory, a fancy new cover by the illustrious Nikki McClure, and, oh yeah, it is $3 postage-paid&mdash;in bulk you can get 10 copies for $15. Here is a quick explanation of why we made it into a book if our 1,250 word version seems daunting: it was the only way we could sustain its distribution, was what we saw as the next step towards helping it gain a wider audience, and we just plain love the story and want it to be presented as well as possible. Oh, and we'd like to take this opportunity to publicly proclaim our enormous affection for and appreciation of Viv-o, who is the best damn proofreader and pal we could could ever ask for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we put together a little deal called the Letter Opener Set, limited to the first 250 mailorder copies, which includes copies of the first two titles in the CrimethInc. Letters series (Stone Hotel &amp; Off the Map), wrapped in a handsome, hand letter-pressed paper band proclaiming such. Two books together for $10&mdash;it's basically $3 off and a fancy wrapper as a thanks for those who are so generous in supporting our anarchist publishing projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of Stone Hotel, well, we wanted to try and maybe convince some more of y'all to give it a try. While many of you have indeed obtained the book, and the feedback has been absolutely gushing, it is clear to us that still more of you are holding off. We'd guess the two most obvious reasons are a) it is a poetry book and b) it is expensive. Well, frankly those are good reasons, but the book is very important to us, we feel its role to be vital as part of what CrimethInc. has published to date, and we really want it to make a little more headway in the world. Yes, it is poetry, but here is a link to some new reviews, including a rather eloquent one from Clamor (&quot;One of [CrimethInc.'s] best yet&quot;), maybe they will help relax your doubts? And yes, it is $10, but it is a fundraiser for FFOL, and with the above Letter Opener Set, it just got a little more affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
        As many of you begin to head out on summer adventures, we have decided to thin out our reserves of FFOL, and offer boxes of 150 copies to those of you putting on events or going on tour in one way or another. If this is you, send us an email (house@crimethinc.com) briefly describing your plans, and including your shipping address, and we'll get 'em right off to ya. Of course, donations are delightful (and at this point, very helpful), but not neccesary. On a similar note, we are begining to run out of even our last copies of both Harbinger.4 and Hunter/Gatherer #1. We send out copies in individual mailorders, and we'd like to very nicely request that anyone who has even a small amount of either paper lying around&mdash;that never quite got distributed&mdash;to please send them back to us, we could really use them. We promise we won't be mad&mdash;in fact we'll have a mini-party in celebration of each stack we get back. Thanks for reading this long update, folks, and make sure to get a whole heaping serving of that summer sun&mdash;your skin isn't meant to last forever.

        Between demonstrations, blockades, graffiti missions, jail time, and nervous breakdowns, CrimethInc. cells in the Southeast have been busy over the past months producing new materials. The surprise reunion issue of Inside Front, the decade-running journal covering anticapitalist music, culture, and action, is now available for mailorder. The first CD by Greensboro anarcho-punks Blacken the Skies is out now, and the band is touring the eastern half of the U.S.A. with an extensive distribution of CrimethInc. material and other propaganda. The Urban Pirates&rsquo; follow-up issue to the first Hunter/Gatherer is also out now, on the unusual format of audio CDR, and is available from their address. Finally, the plans for this summer&rsquo;s CrimethInc. Barnstorming Tours have been made public. If you&rsquo;re at a loss for how best to apply your talents this summer, please get in touch. Here&rsquo;s to hoping you&rsquo;re all busy with similarly ambitious projects of your own. Now is not the time to feel defeated and be silent&mdash;we have to build on all the connections and capabilities we forged in the antiwar struggle, so one day soon we can stop them from ever having a war again.

Subversive Action Kits with a revised &quot;This Phone Is Tapped&quot; sticker, and a new &quot;Fortified with 100% pure Iraqi blood&quot; sticker made to be put on gas pumps. We learned from our mistakes with the first run and this time we used non-glossy paper (the glossiness made the stickers much easier to remove&mdash;bad, bad, bad) and used a special custom-made die-cut to cut only the sticker part (not the backing) so that they just peel off the backing one at a time. And finally, because we printed a whole lot more of them this time (the last ones sold out in one week!), they cost us less, and we dropped the single price by 10% and the bulk prices by 25%.

      <p>
        Essentially a do-it-yourself anarchist convergence disguised as an alternative film festival at the historic Capitol Theatre and surrounding buildings, this weekend will be an opportunity for people to come together to entertain, learn from, and organize with each other. We'll be showing mainstream movies (of potentially subversive content) to attract people from all walks of life; in addition, there will be skillshares, underground documentaries, and an anarchist bookfair, among other things. Saturday the 14th will be a totally free day: free movies, free food and groceries, free professional massages in the lobby&mdash;a tiny demonstration of what a free society might look like.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mainstream movies (showing Friday the 13th through Sunday the 15th) will include Brazil, The Thin Red Line, The Gleaners and I (a French documentary about dumpster-diving), Natural Born Killers and Fight Club (inevitably), and&mdash;on the free day&mdash;Malcolm X, Dead Poet's Society, Three Kings (A Hollywood action movie that takes a surprisingly critical stance on the war with Iraq), and Box of Moonlight. Skillshares will range from direct action tactics to irish folk dancing to seditious graphic design (ahem). We're counting on you to put together your own plans with your affinity groups to multiply the possibilities of this weekend. More details forthcoming, but now you know.
      </p>
      <p>
        A new book, In Search of the World, has been published by a CrimethInc. affiliated cell, Ivory Bell, here is more info.
      </p>
      <p>
        A quick FFOL update: We have sent out about 200,000 copies in 1,500 packages and the PDF has been downloaded about 31,000 times, and here is another desperate plea for donations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we finally recover from Halloween, another huge update will be here at the end of the month&mdash;a new free zine, a new essay, and many spectacular revelations.

    <h1 class="p-name">Culture Offensive Progress Report: Fighting For Our Lives</h1>
    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        As of yesterday, over the two weeks since the paper was printed, we've sent out approximately 625 orders, totaling over 90,000 copies, and the PDF file has been downloaded from this website about 15,000 times. These are sort of absurd numbers, for a group opposing mass-production and centralization, but the evidence so far is that these papers are being used to create local dialogue&mdash;for example, the pastor at the Presbyterian church that housed anticapitalist demonstrators in D.C. last weekend preached her Sunday sermon from texts in Fighting For Our Lives, as she spoke to the congregation about the value of what the demonstrators were doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now for some other absurd numbers. Thus far, we've spent about $14,000 on production costs, and a little over $3500 on mailing (so far). To offset these costs . . . we've received approximately $500 in donations. Now, we were expecting to lose money on this project, and to fund it in part from the surplus from book sales and so on; but anyone can do the math and determine that an antiprofit collective like ours, which distributes most of its publications for free already, can't pull $17,000 out of the air. We've been able to make it this far on this project only because our printers offer us credit. Of course it would have been ethically and environmentally repugnant to sell advertising or anything like that to fund this&mdash;so what it comes down to is: we depend upon donations to pay for projects like this, in part, and right now we are drastically short of having enough. If any of you want to help us, please do, in whatever way you're able, whether that means setting up a benefit show, taking up a collection, or sending us a couple postage stamps. We're doing our best to raise the rest of the money somehow, but we can't do it alone. Thanks very much. (donate online, or send money through the mail to our Olympia address.)
      </p>
      <p>
        On another note, while the demand for Off the Map has remained very high, the number of people sending us copies has dwindled slowly down to no one, so please try to help out if possible.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        As the old Frenchman counseled, you must always have a secret plan. Our CrimethInc. affinity group has worked long under cover of darkness to complete a publication that can pick up in accessibility and distribution where Harbinger leaves off; today we returned from the printers with 250,000 copies of the 24-page pamphlet Fighting For Our Lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming soon from other affinity and infinity groups: reports on the summer&rsquo;s flying circus tours and convergence; a free how-to graffiti primer; the new edition of the Pickaxe/Breaking the Spell video; further poster campaigns; much, much more.

    <div class="e-content">
      <p>
        The flying circus tours and convergence proved to be everything we&rsquo;d hoped: anarchist lore and merriment were spread far outside the activist ghetto, fast friendships were forged, kids learned in the flames of catastrophe the skills that will make future endeavors twice as effective. The final days in and outside Des Moines were almost unreal&mdash;spontaneous Reclaim the Streets actions in which the police backed off to make way for the fire breathers on stilts, mass naked dancing in public parks, locals quitting their jobs to join us, a spirit of closeness and abandon many of us had never dreamed of experiencing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now most of us who were involved are arriving in the communities in which we&rsquo;ll be operating this fall, and we&rsquo;re hitting the ground running. And so we unveil the prelude to the next stage of our resistance, the Culture Offensive: three new posters, responding to the hysteria occasioned by the anniversary of September 11, and a national wheatpasting campaign to hammer home the point that dissent and defiance are everywhere the television cameras aren&rsquo;t pointing. These are available online and through the mail for all who would like to do their own redecorating of public space and psyche.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming next: a website dedicated to projects like this, on which poster designs will be constantly offered and exchanged, documentation of guerrilla decorating victories posted, and similar campaigns facilitated (see below news posting). A paper, tentatively titled Fighting For Our Lives, designed to introduce anarchy (as opposed to anarchism) to a wider demographic than Harbinger has reached&mdash;which will be available in time for the actions taking place in Washington, D.C. and Denver, Colorado this fall. And, shortly thereafter, the real fun begins . . .

I am looking for one or two people who have (most importantly) a solid, working knowledge of postnuke and php, and who want to become part of a nonhierarchical team responsible for the direction, content and maintenance of the new website&mdash;people who can bring skills, knowledge, ideas and commitment to a website that will probably see more than 100,000 hits a week&mdash;and that is before we start improving it.

        Ok, a few updates here, the most important being the new Circus Tour website&mdash;read all about it in detail and check out the dates for the various legs of the tour. It is shaping up to be quite a grand adventure, and if you get involved, it will be even better. Also, we have received many emails asking if we still need help getting copies of Off the Map and with the CrimethInc. Into Libraries Project, and the answer is: YES! We have received hundreds of copies of OTM and have sent books to more than eighty libraries, but for both projects, we hope this is just the tip of the iceberg and we still need your help. Finally, the post office is increasing the rates for Media Mail and Priority Mail at the end of June, but don't worry, even though this is the second rate increase since we set our prices two years ago, all of our postage paid prices will remain the same. OK, one last thing . . . our next publication, Hunter/Gatherer, is nearing completion and the full details about its newsprint goodness will be here within two weeks. Enjoy the weather, love your friends.

        The CrimethInc. <strong>Aluminum Noise</strong>
        CD, &quot;Totally Fucking Lost&quot; is
        now finished and available, too. Aluminum Noise is a d.i.y. experimental
        noise project undertaken by punk rockers who set out to broaden the spectrum
        of the audio arts, challenging everyone's conceptions of what music itself
        is. This recording has a haunting beauty make sharper by a tension that
        steadily increases over the seventy minutes of music, rather than discharging
        itself. We think it's fucking amazing, like feeling new chambers of the
        heart being carved out--but the average pop punk listener will probably
        find himself alienated and confused. For reviews of this CD, click Stickfigure

        We will be shipping out the reprint of Harbinger 3 in

        orders for more copies than we could afford to pay to print and ship,
        so if you ordered, you will be sure to get some, just not as many as you
        requested. We will not be accepting further requests for Harbingers except
        for single copies with orders, or with stamps. If we had received more
        donations in the form of cash and/or stamps we would have been able to
        print more copies, but we are broke as fuck and could only do 10,000 more.
        Let this be a reminder to all of you when it comes to helping us do free
        projects&#151;without your support these things come out of our pockets
        directly, and our pockets don't have much in them. Watch for news on harbinger

        We are thrilled to announce the new Transatlantic Vagabond Edition (a.k.a.
        European Edition) to be distributed exclusively by the Demon Box Collective
        located outside of Stockholm, Sweden. Its contents
        are identical to the standard version, except for one page inside and
        an alternate back cover. This should provide a much easier and less expensive
        way for our comrades in Europe to get the book.

        Also, due to an incredible response to the book as well as the hard work of
        many CrimethInc. agents across the world who took it upon themselves to
        get the books into needy hands, the first printing of 1500 copies of
        <em>Days of War, Nights of Love</em>
        has sold out in just over one month! We are
        getting the second printing back from the printers on Tuesday, the 17th.
        This is just in time as we got rid of our last copies here in Olympia
        only yesterday. The new printing is exactly the same as the first printing
        and is completely indistinguishable.

        Our latest news is that the Ire and Zegota CDs are finally available, which
        has been long overdue. The Zegota CD is remastered from the LP tapes and
        sounds about twice as good to my ears&#151;I'm not going to bother to rant
        and rave about this band, since they're some of my closest friends and
        favorite musicians, and have been so active in CrimethInc. projects over the
        past year. The Ire CD is their last recording, and I think we all feel
        honored that we could release it . . . I think it really gives substance to
        all the potential they showed on their earlier records. I think of what I'd
        hoped Neurosis would do after <em>Enemy of the Sun</em>, and for me, this is
        the realization of that smothered hope, only coming from a hardcore
        background musically and politically.

        Well, as no doubt you have noticed, the CrimethInc. site is in the midst of a
        total rehaul. For the time being not much more is changing than the design,
        and to a minor degree, the structure. However, we do have long term goals to
        improve the site. If you have any suggestions let us know.

        We here at CrimethInc. are all very excited in anticipation of our first
        book, <em>Days of Love, Nights of War: Crimethink for Beginners</em>. Go to
        its seperate site to get more info on what it is, when it will be ready, and
        how to get it.
