Three years in the making, _**Recipes for Disaster**_ is the long-awaited follow-up to the CrimethInc. collective’s notorious first book, _[Days of War, Nights of Love](/books/days-of-war-nights-of-love)_. This 400-page manual complements the romance and idealism of that earlier work with practical information and instruction. Over thirty collectives collaborated in testing, composing, and editing the book’s 62 sections, which range from _Affinity Groups, Coalition Building,_ and _Mental Health_ to _Sabotage, Squatting,_ and _Wheatpasting_. These are illustrated with extensive technical diagrams and first-hand accounts, and prefaced with a thorough discussion of the diverse roles direct action can play in social transformation. If you’re looking for a tactical handbook for revolutionary action, look no further.

This second edition, released in Fall of 2012, is comprised of the same content as the first edition, and boasts a new larger 7" x 10" format; photos and diagrams that are 77% and 164% larger, respectively; twenty-one new photos and a new introduction; improved typography and readability; and a more durable layflat binding.
