In cooperation with Itâ€™s Going Down, subMedia.tv and others, CrimethInc. are calling for a week of solidarity from 1st to 7th of April to support everyone targeted for standing up to the Trump regime and rising fascism.

Black Mosquito is printing this shirts to show some solidarity to our comrades in the US with wearing that shirt.

Further all surplus of this shirt will be donated to legal funds in the US to support antifascists.
